Calvary is a beautiful place, with no crime, no drama and nestled along the great lakes. It is surrounded in lush forests, quiet, safe, everything you could ever wish for...or is it?\nAs Rue approaches her 17th birthday she is plagued with one problem, a very big one. Her Mother, Grace, has fallen ill. It is not a disease that can easily be fixed with medication, it is one of the mind. Grace has been admitted to Rolling River Asylum and once she is gone, Rue's perfect world starts to crumble around her. Everything she has known is suddenly taken from her and with it her feeling of safety is dissolved.\nDesperate to pull Rue out of her depression, her brother talks her into going to a party at the Graph house, home to Johnathan Graph, a boy Rue has always felt a strong connection to, but never acted on it. Once she is at the party she reconnects with Johnathan and is shocked at how her feelings seem to be so strong for him, but with one touch Rue has a terrifying vision and it sets everything into motion.\nSoon after her revelation at the party, Grace and William suddenly disappear and with their absence two strangers, that of Joshua and Samantha Barrington, enter into Rue's life.

When Disco's maker arrives in New York, he resents Rhiannon on a level she can't begin to comprehend. Yet Marius isn't her most dangerous adversary, not by a long shot. Marius's sire -- a half-demon -- is determined to see the necromancer who stunned the vampire world on her knees. If she won't bend, he'll do everything in his power to make her break.

Dealt a blow from which she can never recover, Rhiannon turns to the only person who can help her: the fallen angel who is relying on Rhiannon to save her soul.

He walked or flew or simply materialized wherever he needed to be, and he knew enough people who owned cars that if one were necessary, they were at his disposal. Had the weather been better, Sariel would've insisted on walking, but John seemed quite eager to get somewhere sheltered. \"I'll ride with you.\"\nAs the family and friends of Marlene Watson pulled their cars away from the cemetery, John walked beside Sariel silently until they reached the green SUV. \"It's unlocked. Hop right on in.\"\n\"Nice ride. I like the color.\" Sariel slipped into the front passenger seat and buckled himself in just as the skies opened up. Rain hit the windshield in quarter-sized droplets.\n\"Thanks. I'm kind of fond of it myself.\" John slid behind the wheel, shut the door, and started the engine. He flipped on the lights and the windshield wipers, and pulled the car onto the gravel road. The last of the few remaining mourners had already pulled out onto the main street. The SUV sat still at the gate, John looking both ways before pulling out. He made a right-hand turn--heading in the opposite direction of the coffee shop. The sound of the car doors automatically locking interrupted the patter of rain on the roof.\nJohn's gaze slid to Sariel along with a smile looking not so pleasant as before. \"Sorry,\" John said. \"Not much of a cinnamon roll fan, and my soul's in no need of warming.\"\nSurprised, it took a moment for Sariel to comprehend the situation. The space between his shoulder blades began to tingle with warning. \"Did I miss something? John, maybe you should just pull over and I'll be on my way.\"\n\"I don't think so, Sariel.\" John's eyes flicked up to check the rear-view mirror, and then re-focused on the road. \"And before you think about pullin' any sort of hocus pocus, I got three words for you: Detective Samantha Wright.\"", "format": "", "authors": [{"author_id": "2871754", "role": ""}, {"author_id": "2871755", "role": ""}], "publisher": "", "num_pages": "27", "publication_day": "", "publication_month": "", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "", "book_id": 8280991, "ratings_count": "16", "work_id": "13129313", "title_without_series": "StarCrossed 3 1/2: Angel Tears"}, {"text_reviews_count": "16", "series": ["277476"], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "eng", "asin": "B005JSRCJA", "average_rating": "3.79", "similar_books": [12637477, 10508775, 11160341, 10890808, 10535171, 12092105, 10335701, 10679230, 10793020, 12872080, 11422644, 11778281, 10429025, 10846226, 9640042, 13060609, 10551037, 10202432], "description": "Savannah Colbert has never known why she's so hated by the kids of the Clann.

Frank is also not in a position to refuse.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Frank's rescue fails--in an explosion of spectacularly misapplied magic. When the dust settles, all parties involved find themselves body-swapped. Frank is left stranded in the Princess Lucille's body, halfway across the kingdom. The understandably angry Princess Lucille finds herself inhabiting the body of the dragon.

Nymah Rose, the last daughter of eight siblings born to a poor mapmaker and his superstitious wife, was a North-born baby. It is said that North-born babies are wild, unpredictable, intelligent, and destined to break their mothers' hearts because they all leave hearth and home to travel to the far ends of the earth. To keep her close, Rose's mother lied and told her she had been born of the obedient and pliable East. But destiny cannot be denied. One day, a great white bear comes to the mapmaker's door to claim Rose's birthright. Everything that comes after, as richly imagined by author Edith Pattou, is the basis for one of the most epic romantic fantasies ever told. Eastis a deftly woven tapestry that melds traditional fairy tale motifs of both Beauty and the Beastand East of the Sun and West of the Moon, with the haunting icy lore of medieval northern lands. Told in a changing chorus of voices, including that of Rose, her hopeful brother Neddy, her regretful father, the charmed white bear, and the Troll Queen whose selfish wish is the catalyst that seals Rose's fate, Eastwill enchant any and all who venture within its pages.

INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR: Q: So, what makes the Nate Temple series special?\nA:I wanted to write a series of stories that mirrored the books I liked to read in my childhood. My top picks were usually urban fantasy, paranormal best sellers, and of course, books featuring your classic gritty, pulp-fiction heroes. Basically, anything with a lot of creepy crawly supernatural characters: mythical creatures, ancient heroes, super villains, and gods. You will find that my stories focus on the ancient myths, characters, and stories we all know, fear, and love. Then twist them up and toss them back like an empty beer can.\nQ: What order should I read the books in?\nA:I've written the series with the intent that they should be read in order to get the full effect of the bigger picture; however the stories can be read in any order if you are looking for a quick, fast-paced romp through Adrenaline-ville. I suggest the following sequence:\nObsidian SonBlood DebtsFairy Tale - Prequel (FREE to email subscribers)Grimm Silver Tongue Beast Master Tiny Gods Wild Side\nQ: So, why should readers give these books a try?\nA:Because the Nate Temple series is a present day thrill-ride that takes no prisoners. Dragons, Angels, Demons, Greek Legends, Wizards, werewolves, and a whole slew of other supernatural 'Freaks' abound in my stories. My books have hit the top ten bestsellers list on Kindle for Urban Fantasy and Paranormal.

Scott Bakker's first novel, the beginning of a large-scale, swords and magic fantasy trilogy. It's a book with historical depth by an author as interested in exploring the philosophy of his world as its violent, conflicted politics. The novel begins a bit slowly as we're introduced to the characters and the world they live in. There's Kellhus, a warrior-monk from a city hidden away for 2000 years, and Achamian, a sorcerer and spy from the Mandate school, whose members all have recurring nightmares of an ancient war. There's an emperor who longs for godhood, a barbarian warlord, and assorted other schemers. And lingering in the background is something truly evil.\nWhen a newly arisen leader declares Holy War, the story brings everyone together. From that moment, the narrative takes off, and Bakker's prose carries the story right along. There's a fair amount of graphic violence, broken up by occasional flashes of humour. Bakker is working a combination that's currently also being explored by Steven Erikson and Sean McMullen: big fantasy worlds with long, deep histories, and characters who can think as well as act. It's a potent mix that elevates The Darkness That Comes Beforewell above most of its competition and bodes well for the rest of the series. --Greg L.

Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser,\" seemingly without moral or sense.\nFor more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.

She definitely never meant to fall in love with him. And she never thought she'd call the vampires her friends, or that to save them she would defy the one person she swore to always protect: her maniacal twin brother, Orion.\nAfter thwarting her brother's plan to wipe out all vampires with a super virus, she thinks she may at last catch a break - until Aden grows ill, and she's thrown into prison for treason.

Wiersema returns with this exquisitely plotted blend of supernatural thriller and domestic drama.\nFor novelist Christopher Knox, getting up early every morning to write isn't bringing him the sense of fulfillment it once did. It's been ten years since his first novel was published, to some acclaim, and he's hit a wall in trying to write his next. His marriage to Jacqui isn't doing much better, and it's been months since he's slept anywhere but his office above the detached garage.\nThe part of Chris's life that isgoing well, and brings him easy joy, is his relationship with his eleven-year-old son, David. While Chris may not make it to all of his son's ball games, their nightly ritual of reading together at bedtime not only helps David overcome his struggles with reading, but is a calm within the storm for them both, when their days are so full of challenges. And what better way for a novelist to connect with his child than through their mutual love of books, and a bedtime story routine as unwavering as Chris's love for his son.\nWhen Chris comes across a book by one of his favourite childhood authors in a local used bookstore, he knows it will be the perfect gift for David's birthday. To the Four Directionsis not one Chris has read before, but he knows that Lazarus Took's adventurous, magical stories of young heroes and other realms would be just the thing for David, as they were for him. David is less than thrilled to receive a book he's never heard of before, however - he'd been hoping for The Lord of the Rings- and Jacqui is quick to see it as yet another sign of Chris's detachment from David's life.\nBut once they start reading the novel together, David is completely enthralled, to the extent that he truly cannot put the book down. The story, of a young peasant boy who is plucked from his home by castle guards and sent on a quest for a mysterious Sunstone, makes David feel like he is right there, in the action. Even after his parents have to take the book away from him, he can't help but sneak it back to his room. As David is reading alone that night, he suffers an inexplicable seizure and falls into a state of unconsciousness. Doctors perform a barrage of tests, but cannot determine what's wrong. And as David's seizure recurs every night, his father learns that only one thing will calm it: being read to from his strange new book.\nTrue to his nature, as someone with an inherent belief in the power of words, Chris becomes convinced that the secret of David's collapse lies within the pages of To the Four Directions. After failed attempts to find out more about Lazarus Took from his estate, Chris traverses the continent in search of the truth. Meanwhile, David wakes up within the story he has been reading - as the boy he has been reading about - and finds himself facing perils unimaginable, in a world that he soon realizes was created to capture the hearts and souls of children like him. Because he's not alone as he takes over the hunt for the Sunstone, but accompanied by those boys who have come before him. And as the quests of father and son lead them toward a fateful collision of worlds, David realizes that while he's not the first to fall victim to the book's horrific spell, perhaps he can prove himself strong enough to be the last.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.", "format": "Paperback", "authors": [{"author_id": "587983", "role": ""}], "publisher": "Vintage Canada", "num_pages": "496", "publication_day": "2", "publication_month": "8", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2011", "book_id": 10859973, "ratings_count": "32", "work_id": "10326375", "title_without_series": "Bedtime Story"}, {"text_reviews_count": "17", "series": ["911546"], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "en-US", "asin": "B015F5WLV0", "average_rating": "4.07", "similar_books": [26258630, 26184421, 26126312, 30364737, 305297, 26059780, 25908035, 27270731, 25915461, 26534094, 2098341, 186914, 601917, 2098182, 13459783, 30116984, 25460653, 16769704], "description": "In Seattle for her best friend's wedding, curvy Grace is immediately attracted to the best man, Kingston Meade.

Many readers may recall the poignancy of Oscar Wilde's The Happy Princeor Han Christian Andersen.\nThe collection is capped by two delightful stories-within-a-story, in which the assorted members of a quirky family compose alternate episodes of a slightly gothic romance with hints of Poe and Saki (in \"On Love and Beauty\") and a wildly elaborate retelling of Rapunzel that is engaging, horrifying, and touching by turns (in \"Lanterns of Romance\").\nAll in all, these warm, inventive, and life-affirming stories will strike a deep, satisfying chord in many readers.", "format": "Paperback", "authors": [{"author_id": "113561", "role": ""}, {"author_id": "324549", "role": "Translator"}], "publisher": "Kodansha", "num_pages": "184", "publication_day": "16", "publication_month": "1", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2001", "book_id": 194739, "ratings_count": "270", "work_id": "297542", "title_without_series": "Blue Bamboo: Japanese Tales of Fantasy"}, {"text_reviews_count": "352", "series": ["242635"], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "en-US", "asin": "", "average_rating": "3.70", "similar_books": [27238448, 10650775, 17834438, 6450262, 7160522, 8547975, 13539451, 10880685, 9798470, 11458531, 13409305, 6991240, 6669826, 15995198, 8025911, 17884655], "description": "WANTED Single human female to join charming, wealthy, single male were-cougar for a night of romantic fun--and maybe more. \nMe: The tall, sensuous, open-minded leader of my clan. \nYou: A deliciously curvy virgin who's intimately familiar with what goes bump in the night.

He would spend every day very much the same as the days of his apprenticeship in the village counting house tallying other people's coins acquired from other people's wealth garnered from other people's deeds until his never-exceptional life came to a never-exceptional end.\nIt wasn't that he was without dreams. He dreamed them every night; of rescuing the imperiled Caprice Morgan from some terrible rampaging monster or of protecting the virtuous Caprice Morgan from marauding pirates who had somehow come up the river or of returning from a great Quest beyond the village boundaries laden with treasure that he could lay at the feet of the appreciative Caprice Morgan.\nBut each morning he awoke in his straw bed and knew he was just Jarod Klum\nUntil, that is, the coming of the Dragon's Bard.\nEdvard the Just ... Dragon's Bard to the Dragonking Khrag ... blew into Eventide on a late winter wind that some said he created out of his own seemingly inexhaustible supply of words. He swept up Jason with his words and turned the apprentice's world upside down.\nThe Dragon's Bard convinced Jarod to win his fair Caprice through 'heroic deeds of a more manageable scale' - setting Jarod on a course of misadventures that turns the town on its head. Jarod's single-minded pursuit of his greatest wish - even if it is a broken one - escalates until the only thing left for him to do is to become a dragonslayer and save the town from a ferocious, legendary monster that everyone fears but no one has ever seen.\n'Eventide' is brought to life through the stories of the interweaving lives of its citizen characters, their follies, joys, tragedies and triumphs on a scale of life to which we can all relate. In the end, it is a visit to a place where we ourselves would like to settle down and live out our lives as we should.\n'Eventide' centers around Jarod Klum - a young apprentice to his father's counting house - and his heart-sore pursuit of his beloved Caprice Morgan, one of three down-on-their-luck sisters who are struggling to keep a broken wishing well supplied with wishes. His attempts at heroics more often result in calamity and raise the ire of nearly the entire town, but with the help of the DragonBard, the kind friendship of the dwarven smithy and the guidance of a farmer with a mysterious past, Jarod will be victorious - even if it means luring a dragon into the town.\n[Description and coverart from dragonsbard.com; used by permission, 28 May 2010.]", "format": "", "authors": [{"author_id": "868", "role": ""}, {"author_id": "151890", "role": ""}], "publisher": "", "num_pages": "", "publication_day": "", "publication_month": "", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "", "book_id": 10167105, "ratings_count": "207", "work_id": "13899871", "title_without_series": "Eventide (Tales of the Dragon's Bard, #1)"}, {"text_reviews_count": "4", "series": [], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "", "asin": "", "average_rating": "3.54", "similar_books": [332756, 3026012, 903653, 544313, 289590, 2038677, 6234429, 487295, 12954136, 81072, 275843, 57732, 42146, 63339, 473869, 284946, 440696, 803034], "description": "Ethan Feld is bad at baseball.

It pulls him away from his wife and children and into a bewildering mystery. He arrives at his parents' house and discovers that they have a visitor. His sister, Tara. Not so unusual you might think, this is Christmas after all, a time when families get together. But 20 years ago, Tara took a walk into the woods and never came back - and as the years went by with no word from her, the family, unspoken, assumed that she was dead. Now she's back, tired, dirty, dishevelled, but happy and full of stories about 20 years spent travelling the world, an epic odyssey taken on a whim. But her stories don't quite hang together, and once she has cleaned herself up and got some sleep, it becomes apparent that the intervening years have been very kind to Tara. She really does look no different from the young women who walked out the door 20 years ago.\nPeter's parents are just delighted to have their little girl back, but Peter and his best friend, Richie, Tara's one-time boyfriend, are not so sure. Tara seems happy enough, but there is something about her... a haunted, otherworldly quality. Some would say it's as if she's off with the fairies.

A heroine with a keen mind for catching killers and a soft heart for bad boys, Charlie is back in this third sizzling paranormal romance thriller.\nHER LAST WHISPER\nMadness and murder invaded Dr. Charlotte Stone's life when she was just a girl--and made her a woman determined to save others from the horror she survived. An expert in the psychology of serial killers, she's faced down more than her share of human monsters. But Charlie can also communicate with the spirits of those who die violently, an extrasensory skill that has helped the FBI bring lethal predators to justice. Now, after narrowly escaping death a second time, Charlie's ready to step away from the edge . . . before her luck runs out.\nToo bad Charlie is too dedicated for her own good--and too devoted to federal agent Tony Bartoli to say no when he asks her to ride shotgun on yet another risky mission. Of course, she already has her hands full with Michael Garland: the handsome, roguish ghost with whom she's hopelessly in love--a spirit who depends on Charlie to keep him from slipping forever into the dark side of the afterlife. But in the mortal world, beautiful single women are vanishing from Las Vegas hotels at night. All signs indicate that a psychopath is on the prowl in Sin City, and Bartoli's FBI colleague Lena Kaminsky has reason to fear that her missing sister may be just the killer's type.\nIn a town full of fast players and few rules, flushing out a smooth-talking stalker like the Cinderella Killer might be a loser's game. But for Charlie, the only way to cage her quarry is to plunge back into the homicidal hell she vowed to leave behind--and may not leave alive.\nPraise for Her Last Whisper\n\"A tightly written ghostly romantic suspense novel with intriguing supernatural elements and sizzling sexual tension.\"--Kirkus Reviews\n\"An absolute winner . . . explodes with both passion and mystery . . . a tale that will haunt you, providing both thrills and chills.\"--Bookreporter\n\"Outstanding . . .

She was made to survive. But all her training, all the shouted words of her instructors, abandoned her. She couldn't focus on anything, she couldn't concentrate, and it was going to get her killed. She didn't even see the gully until she tripped and fell into it, rolling down the embankment. But it was enough to shake away the fog. That, and the sound of alarms blaring behind her.\nScores of men were emerging from the facility's entrance behind her. Soldiers. A hunting party. Then she heard something else: barking.\nDogs. They had bloody dogs.\nGlancing back, she saw the search beams and heard their shouts. From somewhere behind her, hidden amongst the trees, an air vehicle was sent aloft. Sigrid glanced skyward. Thunderhawks. She counted three of the heavy gunships rising above the canopy of pines. Two of them rumbled toward her and then past, close enough for her to feel the heat of their thruster wash blast over her.\nShe hadn't even remembered cloaking. It was perhaps the only thing that saved her.\nThe third Thunderhawk stayed back. It hovered above the soldiers, moving with them. Belly-mounted floodlights illuminated the woods, lighting their way. They'd be scanning for her. She could only hide so long. She had to move; she had to stay ahead.\nLost, alone and armed only with the stolen knife, Sigrid did the only thing she could. She ran.\nSYNOPSIS:\nThe unthinkable has happened. Sigrid Novak, the most dangerous and wanted person in the history of the Federation of Corporate Enterprises, has been captured. For the women of New Alcyone--women just like her, genetically reengineered and trained since childhood to be the most effective killers in the galaxy--this is a staggering loss. For the Independents, the rebels who captured her, this is a boon beyond measure.\nIf they can figure out how to control her.\nNow, six years have passed since the events of Bellatrix, and for six years Sigrid Novak has been gone, vanished, with no sign, no word and no trace. But all has not been quiet within the Federation. The Council for Trade and Finance has been murdered, assassinated, and the death toll among the Federation's ruling elite continues to rise.\nWith every corporate enclave that falls, the legend grows. They call her the Night Witch. A champion to some, a nightmare for others.

Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters.

These stories of serpentine sexuality are certain to delight the senses.\nThis anthology includes stories by KJ Kabza, Julian Oliver-Fenn, Dean Scarborough, Kannang Feng, Steven Schwartz, Dominic Santi, David Hubbard, Kimber Camacho, and Nobilis Reed.", "format": "ebook", "authors": [{"author_id": "6621883", "role": "Editor"}, {"author_id": "65430", "role": "Editor"}, {"author_id": "4037369", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "6621884", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "6621885", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "115343", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "1351509", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "249502", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "6621887", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "2741640", "role": "Contributor"}, {"author_id": "3406966", "role": ""}], "publisher": "Circlet Press", "num_pages": "", "publication_day": "20", "publication_month": "11", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2012", "book_id": 16243585, "ratings_count": "2", "work_id": "22257830", "title_without_series": "Like a Breath of Flame: Erotic Tales of Dragons"}, {"text_reviews_count": "1", "series": ["448178", "530765"], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "", "asin": "", "average_rating": "4.17", "similar_books": [371030, 49608, 429495, 116351, 202449, 73051], "description": "May you live in interesting times is the worst thing one can wish on a citizen of Discworld -- especially on the distinctly unmagical sorcerer Rincewind, who has had far too much perilous excitement in his life.

He can barely make the rent on his apartment, he drinks so much he can barely make it to the crappy gig that keeps his band afloat, let alone play when he gets there. When he leaves the bar one dark night with a bottle of Jose Cuervo in one hand and his guitar case in the other, he finds he's locked out of his apartment with nowhere to go. As he stands alone in the dark and feeling sorry for himself, he hears a lone harmonica being played in the distance. The sound is deep and powerful, and something in the music draws him away from his doorway and into an old alley where the homeless gather around garbage-can fires. In that alley, Brandt meets the harmonica player, Wally, an old black man who can play the music that Brandt dreams of--the blues. Not the blues as you hear them on the modern radio, but they way they were once played--filled with an extra \"something\" that can't be taught. Despite Wally's warning, Brandt begs the old man to teach him the songs he is playing, and in the ensuing encounter, Brandt is gifted--or cursed--with new abilities. He feels the pain building up around him and inside him. Not his own pain, but the pain of others, the pain of those who have passed away, the pain of those who died with no one to hear their stories. Wally explains it. The music will release the pain, and it is the only thing that will release the pain. Brandt must play, or the pain will build up inside until he destroys his own mind from the weight of it. He becomes a conduit for the pain of the world, and then he is left alone.

Lord Aristos - Noon's new employer - is her erstwhile lover, Ari Carmine, the aforementioned heart breaker. And the number one thing he wants is her.\nWhen Rockthorn Gorge's viaduct is destroyed by Displodo, an enigmatic bomber, killing a dozen settlers and wounding scores more, Noon sets off early to aid in the search and rescue. Ari is listed among the missing and the suspects are legion. But Noon's search is just the beginning. Her journey forces Noon to confront not only those she loves, but also enemies hell-bent on destroying them.", "format": "Paperback", "authors": [{"author_id": "5782149", "role": ""}], "publisher": "Black Willow, LLC", "num_pages": "362", "publication_day": "15", "publication_month": "12", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2016", "book_id": 31373111, "ratings_count": "41", "work_id": "52061938", "title_without_series": "Pocket Full of Tinder (Noon Onyx, #4)"}, {"text_reviews_count": "196", "series": [], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "eng", "asin": "", "average_rating": "3.68", "similar_books": [10845465, 9367827, 23841, 1035647, 1666365, 6684490, 13086449, 25884402, 13393308, 13556139, 13040265, 17563580, 12296004, 11842328, 13052395, 2583561, 7980210, 15849654], "description": "Baird College's Mendenhall echoes with the footsteps of the last home-bound students heading off for Thanksgiving break, and Robin Stone swears she can feel the creepy, hundred-year-old residence hall breathe a sigh of relief for its long-awaited solitude.

Feist's bestselling coming-of-age saga celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of its publication. Feist introduces a new generation of readers to his riveting novel of adventure and intrigue, revised and updated as he always meant it to be written. It is a work that explores strength and weakness, hope and fear, and what it means to be a man--in a kingdom where peace is the most precious commodity of all.\nIf there were two more impetuous and carefree men in the Kingdom of the Isles, they had yet to be found. Twins Borric and Erland wore that mantle proudly, much to the chagrin of their father, Prince Arutha of Krondor. But their blissful youth has come to an end. Their uncle, the King, has produced no male children. Bypassing himself, Arutha names Borric, the eldest twin by seconds, the Royal Heir. As his brother, Erland will have his own great responsibilities to shoulder. To drive home their future roles, Arutha sends them as ambassadors to Kesh, the most feared nation in the world. Borric and Erland will be presented to the Queen of Kesh--the single most powerful ruler in the known world--at her Seventy-fifth Jubilee Anniversary.\nBut they have not even left Krondor when an assassination attempt on Borric is thwarted. Aware that he is being provoked into war, Arutha does not rise to the bait. His sons' journey will not be deterred, for nothing less than peace is riding on it. Yet there is to be no peace for the young princes. When their traveling party is ambushed, Borric disappears and is presumed dead--sending Erland into spirals of rage and grief as he is forced to navigate alone the court intrigues at Kesh. But unbeknownst to anyone, Borric lives and has escaped his captors. In a strange land, with a price on his head, Borric must use all his wits and stamina to find his way back to his brother.\nOn separate paths, the two men--one a fugitive and one a future king--make their journey toward maturity, honor, and duty. For every step they take could sway the fragile peace of the land, as those who crave war rally against them--and become ever more daring.\nFrom the Hardcover edition.", "format": "Paperback", "authors": [{"author_id": "8588", "role": ""}], "publisher": "BantamSpectra", "num_pages": "448", "publication_day": "18", "publication_month": "12", "edition_information": "", "publication_year": "2007", "book_id": 13878, "ratings_count": "16840", "work_id": "747434", "title_without_series": "Prince of the Blood (Krondor's Sons, #1)"}, {"text_reviews_count": "27", "series": ["144615", "183660", "1000455"], "country_code": "US", "language_code": "", "asin": "", "average_rating": "4.17", "similar_books": [7552385, 8320534, 44660, 91981, 144110, 618177, 185200, 28481, 28660], "description": "To the forest on the shore of the Kingdom of the Isles, the orphan Pug came to study with the master magician Kulgan.
