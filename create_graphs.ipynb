Then he learns the truth: he is cousin to the Kjallan emperor. Before he was born, his mother eloped with her beloved, leaving the palace and its intrigues behind. Now Marius returns to the imperial seat, where he will learn healing magic and struggle to adapt his small town soul to big city life.\\nMeanwhile, the neighboring nation of Sardos has collapsed, and refugees are pouring over the border. Isolda, a Sardossian shopkeeper, is among them.She has fled her cruel husband and now ekes out a living on the streets of the imperial city.\\nWhen Marius meets Isolda in the aftermath of a factory explosion, he falls for this determined woman who, like him, is far from home and struggling to find her place. But Isolda faces daily discrimination and harassment, while Marius's imperial relatives parade before him a bevy of women they deem more suitable to his station. Marius must decide: is he the emperor's dutiful cousin, grateful for the gifts that have been given him, or is he his mother's son, prepared to sacrifice everything for love?\",\n",

It's just a thing with me.\\nA lot has happened since we last chatted - some good, some bad. All worthwhile, in the grand scheme. I've dealt with the whole Living Dead thing long enough now to know how to keep it from taking over my life. What I'm still figuring out is how to keep it from wreaking havoc on everyone else's lives. It's a roller coaster, for sure, but I'm convinced that waiting for me somewhere on the other side of the Other Side is a real-life life, not just some artificially-sweetened half-life substitute. I want a family. I want my music.\\nI want the dream come true, not the dream fell through.\\nAnd I'm determined to have it, regardless of how eternal this afterlife thing might be. But it's a hell of a lot to keep track of. Barring any unforeseen developments that might undo all my vampirosity, I may have to grow up a little in order to get it all to work out. I'm ready for that, though.\\nAs fun as it might seem to hang with the Lost Boys, I can't be Peter Pan-pire forever.\",\n",

Calvary is a beautiful place, with no crime, no drama and nestled along the great lakes. It is surrounded in lush forests, quiet, safe, everything you could ever wish for...or is it?\\nAs Rue approaches her 17th birthday she is plagued with one problem, a very big one. Her Mother, Grace, has fallen ill. It is not a disease that can easily be fixed with medication, it is one of the mind. Grace has been admitted to Rolling River Asylum and once she is gone, Rue's perfect world starts to crumble around her. Everything she has known is suddenly taken from her and with it her feeling of safety is dissolved.\\nDesperate to pull Rue out of her depression, her brother talks her into going to a party at the Graph house, home to Johnathan Graph, a boy Rue has always felt a strong connection to, but never acted on it. Once she is at the party she reconnects with Johnathan and is shocked at how her feelings seem to be so strong for him, but with one touch Rue has a terrifying vision and it sets everything into motion.\\nSoon after her revelation at the party, Grace and William suddenly disappear and with their absence two strangers, that of Joshua and Samantha Barrington, enter into Rue's life. They come as protectors, not only to her, but to everyone she loves. Without them she would be lost, but with them she is reminded of how much she does not know. There is a war coming, a war that threatens everything she loves, everything she knows or ever will know. She is forced to face the truth about herself and about her family's history, a truth that stems back to the beginning of time and that of the vampire.\\nRewrite history through the eyes of the immortal.\",\n",

But all that changed the day she agreed to share the spotlight with her best friend and former assistant Evie Tanaka--who\\'s now a badass, fire-wielding superheroine in her own right.

Or that the city has been demon-free for three months in the wake of Evie and Aveda\\'s apocalypse-preventing battle against the evil forces of the Otherworld, leaving Aveda without the one thing she craves most in life: a mission.\\nAll of this is causing Aveda\\'s burning sense of heroic purpose--the thing that\\'s guided her all these years--to falter.\\nIn short, Aveda Jupiter is having an identity crisis.\\nWhen Evie gets engaged and drafts Aveda as her maid-of-honor, Aveda finally sees a chance to reclaim her sense of self and sets out on a single-minded mission to make sure Evie has the most epic wedding ever. But when a mysterious, unseen supernatural evil rises up and starts attacking brides-to-be, Aveda must summon both her superheroine and best friend mojo to take down the enemy and make sure Evie\\'s wedding goes off without a hitch--or see both her city and her most important friendship destroyed forever.',\n",

Now, with his numerous bestsellers, graphic novels, and hit movies like the Hellraiser, Clive Barker has become an industry unto himself. But it all started here, with this tour de force collection that rivals the dark masterpieces of Edgar Allan Poe. Read him and rediscover the true meaning of fear.',\n",

Only old Stour, Master of the Library, realizes the importance of her quest. For Privet seeks an answer to moledom's final mystery: where and what is the Book of Silence, whose scribe nomole knows, whose content none can guess, whose existence many still doubt? Decades of harmony have passed since the brave moles of Duncton saved moledom's peaceful Stone followers from the disciples of the evil Word. But now all is not well. Their system has grown sleepy, while moledom is dangerously complacent about the spread of zealots from Caer Caradoc. Led by the sinister Thripp of Blagrove Slide, the Newborns believe that any other way than theirs to the Stone's Silence is blasphemy and deserves death. As the Caradocian moles gain power, shy Privet, aided by Stour and inspired by the strange and inarticulate Rooster, finds herself the agent of change and renewal in Duncton Wood.\",\n",

That they will own the land their father gave them.\" \" I live for you,\" I say sadly. Eo kisses my cheek. \" Then you must live for more.\" Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations. Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children. But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow-- and Reds like him-- are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class. Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity\\' s overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society\\' s ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies . . . even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Alex doesn't know what he wants to do, how to connect with people or what's good for him. He drifts his way through dead-end jobs and fumbled relationships, unable to find a way out of the rut his life has become. Then he runs into Madigan Sargood and everything changes.\\nA ray of light shining from an almost-forgotten past, Madigan is beautiful and impulsive, enigmatic and passionate beyond measure. This is what it means to live, Alex realises, and to love. Never mind that she can be somewhat possessive. Never mind that his best friend thinks there's something wrong with her, something dangerous even. Never mind that the creepy band of misfits she attracts have all but taken over his home. Madigan fills Alex's life with significance; he will put up with anything to be with her.\\nUntil, without any warning, she kills herself.\\nNow Alex can't seem to get her out of his head, and his world - along with his sanity - begins to disintegrate. Black outs and missing time, conversations he can't recall, people he can't remember. Is this the product of a diseased and lovesick mind, or can Madigan really be trying to communicate with him?\\nWhen the past threatens to obliterate the future, Alex is forced to take action. To save himself and those he loves, he must discover the sinister reason why Madigan took her own life - and why she won't lie still in her grave.\",\n",

Instead, the wealthy Lim family urges her to become a \"ghost bride\" for their son, who has recently died under mysterious circumstances.

       "  'description': \"This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN #0575067861.\\nFor centuries, magicians have compiled grimoires to call up demons. In Victorian London, one ambitious warlock, Peter Owling, designed a book of shadows to summon the Lord of the Demons - Satan himself. The plan backfired, Owling was killed and the book was ripped into four pieces and sent to the far corners of the earth. One fragment wound up in a shipment of books destined for the Colonies.\\nNow, at Humberstone College, a converted 19th-century Gothic convent in Melbourne, a power-hungry group of academics is reassembling Owling's grimoire, bent on the pursuit of eternal life. But they have reckoned without the interference of three twenty-something masters students: Holly, Prudence and Justin.\\nWhen Holly makes contact and falls in love with the ghost of the young man who was once Owling's assistant, the academics begin to fear that their dark secret - the grimoire which is so near to completion - is not as safe as they had previously thought.\",\n",

Martin's classic A Game of Thronesto a stunning finish that merits a place alongside the majestic original on the bookshelf of every fantasy fan.\\nThe death of King Robert Baratheon and the imprisonment of his Hand, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, has set the great houses of Westeros at one another's throats.\\nIn Winterfell, Eddard's eldest son and heir, Robb Stark, has gathered an army and is pushing south, determined to free his father. Along the way, he pledges to marry the daughter of Lord Walder Frey in exchange for a military advantage that allows him to capture Jaime Lannister--a powerful bargaining chip to ensure Lord Eddard's safe release. But it is one thing to capture the Kingslayer and quite another to hold him.\\nMeanwhile, in King's Landing, young King Joffrey has other ideas than an exchange of prisoners. Ignoring the advice of his mother, Queen Cersei, he throws oil on the flames of conflict and ignites a conflagration that seems likely to consume not only the Starks but all of Westeros--unless Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, can bring the mad boy-king to heel.\\nBeyond the Wall, greater dangers are brewing, as a winter as brutal as any in history approaches, bringing with it unnatural creatures out of legend. There, Eddard's bastard, Jon Snow, must decide once and for all where his loyalties lie.\\nAnd across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen will learn the true measure of grief--and emerge from its fiery depths transformed, hardened, and ready to claim what is hers by right: the Iron Throne.\",\n",

Her mentor, the legendary Madame Ackermann, afflicted by jealousy, refuses to pass the torch to her young disciple. Instead, she subjects Julia to the humiliation of reliving her mother's suicide when Julia was an infant. As the two lock horns, and Julia gains power, Madame Ackermann launches a desperate psychic attack that leaves Julia the victim of a crippling ailment.\\nJulia retreats to a faceless job in Manhattan. But others have noted Julia's emerging gifts, and soon she's recruited to track down an elusive missing person--a controversial artist who might have a connection to her mother. As Julia sifts through ghosts and astral clues, everything she thought she knew of her mother is called into question, and she discovers that her ability to know the minds of others--including her own--goes far deeper than she ever imagined.\\nAs powerful and gripping as all of Julavits's acclaimed novels, The Vanishersis a stunning meditation on grief, female rivalry, and the furious power of a daughter's love.\",\n",

From the moment she opens her eyes, the world she remembered ceases to exist, and in its place is a post-apocalyptic realm filled with unimaginable dangers. And one very smoking hot guy who has an uncanny ability to make her blood sing, then boil in a blink of an eye. Dash Darhk is everything her parents would hate. He's six feet and two inches of dark temptation and a killer smile, that's surely left a stream of broken hearts in his wake. But her parents are nowhere to be found. Charlotte is alone in this new world. Destroyed by a toxic mist, the land isn't the only thing altered, but the inhabitants as well. As Charlotte begins the hunt for her family, gifts she's never fathom awake inside her. And with the gifts come problems. Enormous ones. Charlotte is running out of options and places to hide. If she can't figure out who to trust-and fast-she will lose more than her heart. Fans of Hunger Games, The 100, and Divergent will fall in love with Slumber.\",\n",

Nor had she asked for the suicidal task thrust upon her, to hurl an enchanted spear into the eye of Abzu, the Serpent that strove to crush the Egg of the World. The priest doomed her to the curse of She Who Runs, a spell that forces her to run at inhuman speed with no control over her destination. It won\\'t release her until she strikes Abzu blind.\\nBut Lassamtu will discover that all she\\'s ever learned about the creation of her world amounts to lies and deception. Her tormentors will learn she\\'s nowhere near as helpless as they thought. And that\\'s only the start of this sinister yarn.\\nPart mythical fiction, part science fiction, part horror tale, this off-beat short story by CLOCKWORK PHOENIX editor and Nebula Award nominee Mike Allen first appeared in the anthology SKY WHALES AND OTHER WONDERS (ed.

They'll promise you everything you could ever desire, but the price tag may be steeper than you can handle. Whether tempting and seducing mortals, defiling angels, or reveling among themselves, the fiendish creatures in these four haunting tales know that while good is okay, evil is just more fun.\\nThaddeus sold his soul to save his family long ago, but the deal he struck with the demon Belial has him spending eternity managing Le Carnaval du Diable, filled to the brim with other's damned into servitude. Belial wants more than Thaddeus' soul, though, and his constant advances only add to Thaddeus' stress as he faces a threat to The Devil's Midway.\\nCraig Peters finds himself Hell Boundand destined for an eternity of torture at the hands of the demon Karawan, despite having no memory of the sin that condemned him to this existence. Over time, though, those memories return, along with an unnatural attraction to Karawan, which leads them both down a path neither of them could have possibly imagined.\\nWhen the Hounds Come Out to Play, Ryu and Keir are released from their chains to hunt the wayward damned and drag them down to Hell. A breath of freedom is an opportunity for fun, however, and Ryu isn't about to waste it, even if it means getting caught in a case of mistaken identity with a handsome stranger.\\nFinally, Beltran is a man of heritage and honor, and when his cousin is brutalized, he has few qualms about consulting a local Inca shaman on her behalf. Little does he know the price of the charm he seeks will make him The Seventh Sacrificein the amarudemon Kitara's ancient quest for revenge.\",\n",

Outcast then from Etruria, Vesi bears Horatrim, a child who carries inexplicable knowledge and grows to manhood in only six years. But a savage Roman attack leaves Vesi unresponsive and Horatrim homeless and vulnerable, and he travels to Rome where his talents confound powerful businessman Propertius, who arranges to adopt Horatrim as a son, changing his name to Horatius.\\nAnd all the while his demon father is seeking him to kill him, for Horatius is a conduit through which the demon might be found and destroyed.',\n",

Half demon, half gargoyle, Layla has abilities no one else possesses.\\nRaised among the Wardens--a race of gargoyles tasked with hunting demons and keeping humanity safe--Layla tries to fit in, but that means hiding her own dark side from those she loves the most. Especially Zayne, the swoon-worthy, incredibly gorgeous and completely off-limits Warden she's crushed on since forever.\\nThen she meets Roth--a tattooed, sinfully hot demon who claims to know all her secrets. Layla knows she should stay away, but she's not sure she wants to--especially when that whole no-kissing thing isn't an issue, considering Roth has no soul.\\nBut when Layla discovers she's the reason for the violent demon uprising, trusting Roth could not only ruin her chances with Zayneit could brand her a traitor to her family. Worse yet, it could become a one-way ticket to the end of the world.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Livvy thought she lost her chance for a Happily Ever After when she dismissed the wish fairy who knocked on her door, so when a prime specimen of masculinity appears on her front lawn one stormy night, she can't quite believe it. Like a prince in distress, he needs her kiss to bring him out of his enchanted sleep.\\nAfter a war injury left him paralyzed, Joe Kimball never expected to walk again, but when he regains the use of his legs thanks to his sexy neighbor, he can't argue when she insists the credit belongs to a wish fairy. Nor does he want to. Arguing is the last thing on his mind now that he is a whole man again.\\nUnfortunately, a few days of hot sex do not a fairy-tale ending make, and as the magic becomes increasingly volatile, Joe and Livvy realize there's much more at stake than just their happiness.\\nThis book is no longer available under this title.\",\n",

While most of Humanity finds the event fascinating, two British explorers know the horrible truth. The rotating moon is the legendary sign that foreshadows the return of a prehistoric demon, the monstrous destroyer of Atlantis, an unkillable colossus known only as the deadly, dreaded Squid God.Racing around the world, and against the clock, Prof. Einstein and Lord Carstairs battle the fanatical legions of Squid God worshippers in a valiant effort to stop the ghastly rebirthing ceremony and keep the demonic mollusk locked in the stygian depths of its unearthly lair. Authors Nick Pollotta & James Clay have lovingly crafted a splendid Fantasy/Adventure, heavily laced with their classic off-the-wall humor, and sprinkled with a light dusting of parody toward the legendary works of H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and just about everything else from the golden glory days of Victorian England.\"Rewrites literary history, remodels London worse than the Blitz, and convinces that it is wise never to deny the supremacy of British womanhood!

She has a great job, the perfect apartment, every material possession a girl her age could desire. Unfortunately, she also has an unusual condition that has forced her to keep everyone at a distance.\\nEthan Kellar has spent his entire life running from destiny. When he was just a boy, a powerful seer prophesied his role in events that would determine the outcome of the secret war his people had been fighting for centuries. A role he was determined not to accept, leading him to avoid letting anyone get too close, until the night Alexa fell into his arms.\\nDrawn to her in a way that he has never experienced, Ethan decides to take the ultimate risk by trusting Alexa and revealing to her all that he truly is. Thinking she is an ordinary woman, he believes that she could be his key to preventing the prophecy from being fulfilled and allowing him to live the life he has always wanted, one that he chooses. Having been so consumed with the desire to determine the course of his own life he wants no less for Alexa and knows he must tell her everything, give her a choice. Before that happens they surrender to the intense physical attraction between them and he realizes too late that in trying so hard to change his fate, he may have set the events of the prophecy in motion.\\nIn that moment, Ethan makes the most difficult decision of his life and does the only thing he can to save Alexa. He walks away.\\nConsumed by grief, Alexa falls into a deep depression until she learns that her brief encounter with love resulted in a child and somehow finds the strength to put herself back together for the sake of her baby Chloe.\\nNearly two years after Ethan walked out Chloe develops an unexplained illness that sends Alexa in search of anything that can help. Her pursuit leads her back to Ethan and thrusts her into his dark and mysterious world, unlocking the secrets of her past and revealing threats to their future. Together, Alexa and Ethan fight to protect Chloe and their love, but there is one battle Ethan fights alone as he struggles to choose his own path and avoid the choices of fate.',\n",

       "  'description': \"There is always a price to pay... Rhiannon Murphy visited the future, witnessed hell on earth and made choices to change things for the greater good. Unfortunately there are consequences for her actions, the penalties for her interference possibly more than she can bear. Determined to sever her debt with a fallen angel, she pushes everything aside, focusing on locating Marigold Vesta's resting place. Until death comes knocking at her door. When Disco's maker arrives in New York, he resents Rhiannon on a level she can't begin to comprehend. Yet Marius isn't her most dangerous adversary, not by a long shot. Marius's sire -- a half-demon -- is determined to see the necromancer who stunned the vampire world on her knees. If she won't bend, he'll do everything in his power to make her break. No price is too high, meaning no one is safe -- including Disco and Paine. Dealt a blow from which she can never recover, Rhiannon turns to the only person who can help her: the fallen angel who is relying on Rhiannon to save her soul. Bartering with a creature from Heaven is probably just as dangerous as starting a war with a demon from Hell, but with nothing to lose it's no longer about life or death. It's about getting even.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Normal people don't believe their nightmares stalk them. They don't fall in love with boys who don't exist, either.\\nSeventeen-year-old Layla Labelle, though, is far from normal. Her delusions walk the earth. Her hallucinations hunt her, and her skin heats to a burn every time her anger flares. Or is that all in her head?\\nLayla doesn't know what to believe any more because if none of that's true, Max MacLarnon must be an illusion, and her heart must still be broken. No matter how much she wants to believe Max is real, doing so would mean everything else is, too. How, then, is that possible?\\nThe answers lie in an age-old legend the supernatural aren't prepared to reveal, and with a curse that could tear Layla and Max apart forever--if it doesn't kill them both first.\\nLearning the truth will mean fighting an arsenal of demons, and being with Max will put Layla on a path toward her own destruction. Just how far will Layla go to protect the one she loves? The answer may never be far enough... away.\",\n",

It begins in a near-future world where sex-vending machines and genital transplants are taken for granted. Prior Gross, the hero and sex object of this wild adventure, thinks his fantasies have all come true when a beautiful young woman seduces him on a public beach. She turns out to be a succubus, beginning his initiation into a realm populated by demons that are not merely horned, but horny. He encounters a perverse cast of characters that includes a satyr, a vampire, and a pair of luscious sisters, one of whom tricks him out of his manhood. \\nSo Prior Gross sets out on a perverse odyssey, taking him to a distant planet where he discovers the key to the return of his property and, ultimately, the origin of the universe itself.\\nThe kindle edition is no longer available from amazon.',\n",

But, it was getting harder. I loved him and it's not as if I never knew it would be difficult loving a vampire. I just never knew the degree of difficulty it would entail.'\\nMichel battles his rising Dark, all but losing his Light within. His line falters, his life is in turmoil and Lucinda is ultimately shut out. Without his kindred to draw him back to the Light, just how Dark will Michel become? And can Lucinda survive without him in her life? To bring him back towards the Light they both must face harsh truths and their deepest secrets and desires. But a vampire's number one rule is survive at all costs. Just what will Michel do to survive and how will it affect Lucinda?\\nAn ancient vampire appears in London feasting on innocents with abandon. Lucinda's role as the Sanguis Vitam Cupitorcalls her to the streets of Knightsbridge and into the grasp of this powerful and hungry Dark predator. Calling on all her reserves she is barely able to survive with her life, but fails to save those humans he blithely kills. Guilt wages with fear as she realises this is not a one-time event and attempts to discover the meaning behind his appearance and Dark hunger which cannot be assuaged.\\nIn the shadows left by the Dark vampire lurks a strange new threat. Dressed in the guise of a mischievous, gorgeous and compelling young man who catches Lucinda in a spell which could not possibly be of this Earth. It's not just his beauty that traps Lucinda though, it's the fact that he has Light. A Light so similar to her own that she is drawn to it, can't stop herself reaching for it. But she ultimately knows, to touch it could prove her downfall. But, can she resist?\\nThe world is turning Darker, greater threats than vampires are about to appear and Lucinda is the key. Try as she might, without her kindred by her side her chances of success are dimmed. For together they are stronger, apart they grow weaker. And there are always those on the sidelines who are willing to take advantage of the weak. They are vampyre, it is in their nature to hunt prey and Lucinda is the ultimate game for the predator within.\",\n",

In the cemetery scene in StarCrossed 3: Objects in the Mirror, did you wonder how the injured angel Sariel came to be in John Banks\\' possession? Angel Tears answers that question while offering a deeper look at these two important characters from the StarCrossed universe.\\nContent Warning: This title contains adult language, graphic violence, coerced sex with dubious consent, and generally dark themes.\\nExcerpt:\\nAngels had very little need for cars, and Sariel\\'s nature didn\\'t allow him to have things in his possession just for the thrill of having. He walked or flew or simply materialized wherever he needed to be, and he knew enough people who owned cars that if one were necessary, they were at his disposal. Had the weather been better, Sariel would\\'ve insisted on walking, but John seemed quite eager to get somewhere sheltered. \"I\\'ll ride with you.\"\\nAs the family and friends of Marlene Watson pulled their cars away from the cemetery, John walked beside Sariel silently until they reached the green SUV. \"It\\'s unlocked. Hop right on in.\"\\n\"Nice ride. I like the color.\" Sariel slipped into the front passenger seat and buckled himself in just as the skies opened up. Rain hit the windshield in quarter-sized droplets.\\n\"Thanks. I\\'m kind of fond of it myself.\" John slid behind the wheel, shut the door, and started the engine. He flipped on the lights and the windshield wipers, and pulled the car onto the gravel road. The last of the few remaining mourners had already pulled out onto the main street. The SUV sat still at the gate, John looking both ways before pulling out. He made a right-hand turn--heading in the opposite direction of the coffee shop. The sound of the car doors automatically locking interrupted the patter of rain on the roof.\\nJohn\\'s gaze slid to Sariel along with a smile looking not so pleasant as before. \"Sorry,\" John said. \"Not much of a cinnamon roll fan, and my soul\\'s in no need of warming.\"\\nSurprised, it took a moment for Sariel to comprehend the situation. The space between his shoulder blades began to tingle with warning. \"Did I miss something? John, maybe you should just pull over and I\\'ll be on my way.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think so, Sariel.\" John\\'s eyes flicked up to check the rear-view mirror, and then re-focused on the road. \"And before you think about pullin\\' any sort of hocus pocus, I got three words for you: Detective Samantha Wright.\"',\n",

Only emotions produced as a result of his own actions are suitable sustenance, but granting wishes in public has been backfiring on his kind for centuries.

Finding out that she had an ancestor with the same name, a woman that led a romantic and important life in the Old West, leads her to an experience of a lifetime, only it isn't her life.\\nIn hindsight, maybe agreeing to a 'totally authentic' experience wasn't as good an idea as the people at the Agency had insisted. Mind numbing terror and pain, didn't fit into the 'enjoyable' category as far as she was concerned, but perhaps someone else was getting more of a kick out of this than the client. On the other hand she has to admit that getting to know her leading man was quite another matter.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When Ichabod Crane, a soldier from the Colonial Army, is resurrected from his grave, more than two centuries after he was killed in battle, he partners with Lieutenant Abbie Mills of the Sleepy Hollow Police Department to fight the evil forces that have taken hold of the town. \\nIt's a cold day in January, and Ichabod visits Patriots Park for a moment of peace. Instead, he receives a disturbing vision from his wife, Katrina, in which she delivers a cryptic but urgent message: he must retrieve the Congressional Cross that he was awarded by the Second Continental Congress for bravery in action. There's just one problem: Ichabod was killed before he ever received the medal, and he is unsure where it might be. Together Ichabod and Abbie set out to uncover the mystery of the cross and its connection to George Washington and his secret war against the demon hordes. They soon learn that a coven of witches is also seeking the cross in order to resurrect their leader, Serilda, who was burned at the stake during the Revolutionary War. Now they must locate the cross before the coven can bring back Serilda to exact her fatal revenge on Sleepy Hollow.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Second Edition\\nAloysius, the magical black cat and powerful witch's familiar, isn't afraid to go into battle to protect his master, but the outcome of the fight turns his feline world upside down. A direct hit of magic steals not only his memories and power, but even the body he's lived in for several centuries. When he wakes up naked on the floor of a veterinarian's office, it isn't as the cat Aloysius, but as the sixteenth-century French gentleman Alain Bellarose. And when Alain sees sexy and enigmatic veterinarian Luke Elliott, he decides he'll make the best of his time as a human.\\nLuke is a man with secrets who generally prefers the company of animals--though the flamboyant boy who washes his face with the side of his hand and tries to lick his own privates might prove an exception.\\nMeanwhile, Witch Master Killian Barth and his secret weapon, Sammy, struggle without Aloysius's power to draw on. Two evil females are circling, and seeing the coven's weakness, they're about to move in for the kill. When Alain's memories return, he's faced with the ultimate dilemma: protect his community or stay with the man he loves.\\nFirst Edition published by Loose Id, 2013.\",\n",

Fleeing from the consequences, he makes for England, on the way picking up two companions - a young boy, Dariole, and a ship-wrecked 'demon'. Dariole is discovered first to be a girl, and then to be Rochefort's sister; the 'demon' is Tanaka Saburo, a Japanese samurai on ambassadorial mission to England from the Shogun; and Rochefort is found by a pack of Hermetic mages and conspirators, who want him to arrange the same thing for King James I/VI of England as he did for Henri of France. Rochefort is blackmailed into arranging the death of King James at the performance of a Hermetic magic play. Meanwhile, Dariole is busy making forays into Shakespeare's theatre as England's first (and worst) female actor ...1610 really isn't Rochefort's year - And as the play's performance and the assassination approach, Rochefort's dreams of the future that may spring from this crucial year grow increasingly stranger and more contradictory. He realises he must act - but, how? What is the right choice? And how much of the future will depend on what he does?\",\n",

The plants taste like chocolate, jewels appear in the soil, bugs talk to her, and her best friend is a rhubarb plant named Harry. But the most magical thing is that every single Monday, at exactly 1:00, it rains. Until the Monday when the rain just stops. Now it's up to Polly to figure out why, and whether her brother's mysterious illness and her glamorous aunt Edith's sudden desire to sell the farm have anything to do with it. Most of all, Polly has to make it start raining again before it's too late. Her brother's life, the plants' survival, and her family's future all depend on it. Kathleen Van Cleve has woven an unforgettable coming-of-age tale with all the heart and wonder of a Roald Dahl novel.\",\n",

They are not even your typical Shape Shifters. Sure, they try to live an ordinary life. At least, as ordinary as the Prince and the Princess of the rivaling ancient Races--the Winter wolves and the Summer leopards--can live. But eventually they learn that not much about their existence can be normal. Especially when the Races' two commanding Goddesses are involved.\\nOne of the Goddesses is on a quest to tilt the scale of power to her side. The other will never let it happen, even if it means kicking Jatred and Jasmira's love to the curb. Nothing is off limits, including removing Jatred's memories of Jasmira.\\nTo complicate things even more, there are the Universe's powers to consider. They are trapped in an ancient Amulet in order to protect the stability of the world. But the Universe has a mind of its own, and when the powers are unleashed, the forces of nature are disturbed; earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions shake the Earth. All Shifters of both Races are summoned by their respective Goddesses to fight in the name of, or against, the normalcy of the world.\",\n",

But Tsar Alexander III forbids women to attend medical school; his interest in Katerina extends only to her ability to raise the dead. Twice now, Katerina has helped him by using her power to thwart the forces of darkness--vampires bent on resurrecting the lich tsar Konstantin Pavlovich so that he can take what he sees as his rightful place on the throne.

Now he is searching for the Morning Star, a sword that will allow him to command a legion of supernatural warriors.\\nKaterina must find the sword before Konstantin does--and she must travel to Egypt to do so. Along the way, she puts up with unwanted attention from her former fiance, the nefarious Prince Danilo, and struggles with her feelings for her true love, George Alexandrovich.

After a failed attempt at a serious seduction in Savannah, Judas has the opportunity to rekindle a possible flame with the one girl that interests not only himself, but his hound side as well. The photos she starred in were a green light, and he's more than focused on making her his. Especially when he finds out she's the tour photographer for the summer tour Will It and Morbid Museum has set up. Canadys Herrera sees the tour as the best way to make her name in the industry. Being the tour photographer, as well as the preferred photog for Morbid Museum, is a dream come true, and she's determined to prove their faith in her is well placed. She just can't let her interest in Judas get in the way. When Judas reignites both their needs, it leads to a tour of kinky sex and unbridled passions...passions that culminate in Judas realizing Canadys is his Mate. But nothing is ever easy, and Canadys, for all her perfection, has horrible family members, family that would rather see her dead than happy. And with threats to his Mate real, Judas is going to have to enlist the help of the one person he's avoided his whole life, his uncle.

The sacrificial virgin survived, but the whole incident left Frank, a respectable career thief, on the run from a kingdom full of evil cultists eager to replace their sacrifice.\\nSo, when the Court Wizard of Lendowyn, Elhared the Unwise, comes to him intending to hire someone to save Lendowyn's princess from an evil dragon in return for riches, glory, and help with the bloodthirsty cultists problem, Frank is rightfully suspicious. Frank is also not in a position to refuse.\\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Frank's rescue fails--in an explosion of spectacularly misapplied magic. When the dust settles, all parties involved find themselves body-swapped. Frank is left stranded in the Princess Lucille's body, halfway across the kingdom. The understandably angry Princess Lucille finds herself inhabiting the body of the dragon. In order to set things right, they will have to team up and face down thugs, slavers, elvish bookies, knights in shining armor, an evil Queen, and the hordes of the Dark Lord Natalc.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"In the rural villages of Norway, there is an ancient belief that children inherit the qualities of the direction in which they are born. Nymah Rose, the last daughter of eight siblings born to a poor mapmaker and his superstitious wife, was a North-born baby. It is said that North-born babies are wild, unpredictable, intelligent, and destined to break their mothers' hearts because they all leave hearth and home to travel to the far ends of the earth. To keep her close, Rose's mother lied and told her she had been born of the obedient and pliable East. But destiny cannot be denied. One day, a great white bear comes to the mapmaker's door to claim Rose's birthright. Everything that comes after, as richly imagined by author Edith Pattou, is the basis for one of the most epic romantic fantasies ever told. Eastis a deftly woven tapestry that melds traditional fairy tale motifs of both Beauty and the Beastand East of the Sun and West of the Moon, with the haunting icy lore of medieval northern lands. Told in a changing chorus of voices, including that of Rose, her hopeful brother Neddy, her regretful father, the charmed white bear, and the Troll Queen whose selfish wish is the catalyst that seals Rose's fate, Eastwill enchant any and all who venture within its pages. It is a tale for the Ages, and for all ages. Highly recommended. (Ages 12 and older) --Jennifer Hubert\",\n",

Quaeryt is a scholar and a friend of Bhayar, the young ruler of Telaryn. Worried about his future and the escalating intrigues in Solis, the capital city, Quaeryt persuades Bhayar to send him to Tilbor, conquered ten years earlier by Bhayar's father, in order to see if the number and extent of occupying troops can be reduced so that they can be re-deployed to the border with warlike Bovaria.\\nQuaeryt has managed to conceal the fact that he is an imager, since the life expectancies of imagers in Lydar is short. Just before Quaeryt departs, Bhayar's youngest sister passes a letter to the scholar-imager, a letter that could well embroil Quaeryt in the welter of court politics he had hoped to leave behind. On top of that, on his voyage and journey to Tilbor he must face pirates, storms, poisonings, attempted murder, as well as discovering the fact that he is not quite who he thought he was. To make it all worse, the order of scholars to which he belongs is jeopardized in more ways than one.\\nScholar is a Kirkus Reviews Best of 2011 Science Fiction & Fantasy title.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Brooklyn is nearly sixteen-years-old and feels like she's invisible. She desperately wants to be pretty and popular, and to be adored by a cute guy. Luckily for her, she's a witch about to come of age ~ so she's only a few spells away from making it all happen. On her milestone birthday, Brooklyn's conservative parents finally unbind her powers, and this newfound freedom leads to a spell-assisted dream makeover. Her crush, Asher, finally notices her, and so does the Queen Bee of the popular, cool clique. Even better, Brooklyn discovers her true power: the ability to magically match couples with a love spell.\\nBut Brooklyn's quest for popularity is not without its price, and as the clique escalates their initiation tests, the more she relies on her powers to complete the tasks. Can Brooklyn keep her magic hidden from their scrutiny? Like her Salem ancestors, if caught, she could be vilified. But worst of all, Brooklyn runs the risk of losing what she really cares about ~ Asher ~ unless she can work a little magic of her own.\",\n",

Maya, leader of the temple maenads, has learned nothing but contempt for the weakness of her human body. She lives for the ritual that transforms her into maenad form, ready to administer the vengeance of the volcano god. Killing a fugitive shifter is not just her duty, but her delight--until, against all odds, he captures her, trapping her in her worst nightmare. Her vulnerable, easily controlled human form. Marked for destruction by his forbidden gifts, empath and shifter Philos fled the city years ago to become a warrior for persecuted people like him. Now he has the enemy at his mercy--a maenad desperate to regain her power. But when they touch, he finds his empathic power not so much a gift as a terrible danger. To his people, and his heart. Gradually, Maya realizes Philos is not a monster deserving of death. Yet even as she hesitantly offers to help in the war against the priests, she can risk no more than the bare beginnings of friendship with the man she was supposed to kill. Anything more, and she will forever lose access to the power she cannot bear to live without... Warning: Contains violence, deadly spider-venom, sex that gets interrupted at the last minute, sex that doesn't get interrupted at the last minute, and plenty of not-your-usual shape-shifters.\",\n",

And as her wedding gift to Titus, Azurha wants to give him answers. She suspects an unknown poison was involved, and her search for the truth enlists two unlikely allies.\\nModius Varro's thirst for knowledge caused an uproar in Emona three years ago and exiled him to the border town of Madrena. But when Titus falls victim to the same poison, his expertise in medicine becomes essential in solving both the riddle of the former emperor's death and finding a cure to save the current one. His search leads him to far reaches of the Alpirion realm, to an ancient culture shrouded in secrets, and into the arms of one slave who must break her silence to save the empire.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Severance is the bone-chilling, adrenaline-filled sequel to Volition. Charlotte finds herself hoping against reason that her life couldn't really have taken the devastating turn that it has. With Joel still dangerously out of the picture, and no signs that he may ever come back, she finds herself up against an even more dangerous threat. A sexy and cunning threat that is bound to tear what she has always known to be her reality down for good. When things finally start to look up, another curve-ball is thrown her way, promising to give her what she'd hoped for since meeting Joel, an answer it seems that came a little too late. What Charlotte thought she'd once known to be the truth filters through her hands, leaving her to believe that her world and the afterworld are much more tangled than she'd originally expected. She comes to find that love and lust are no longer the sole deciders of her fate, but revenge. A lifetime of secrets unfold and Charlotte discovers that Joel hasn't been the only one watching over her all of these years.\",\n",

INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR: Q: So, what makes the Nate Temple series special?\\nA:I wanted to write a series of stories that mirrored the books I liked to read in my childhood. My top picks were usually urban fantasy, paranormal best sellers, and of course, books featuring your classic gritty, pulp-fiction heroes. Basically, anything with a lot of creepy crawly supernatural characters: mythical creatures, ancient heroes, super villains, and gods. You will find that my stories focus on the ancient myths, characters, and stories we all know, fear, and love. Then twist them up and toss them back like an empty beer can.\\nQ: What order should I read the books in?\\nA:I've written the series with the intent that they should be read in order to get the full effect of the bigger picture; however the stories can be read in any order if you are looking for a quick, fast-paced romp through Adrenaline-ville. I suggest the following sequence:\\nObsidian SonBlood DebtsFairy Tale - Prequel (FREE to email subscribers)Grimm Silver Tongue Beast Master Tiny Gods Wild Side\\nQ: So, why should readers give these books a try?\\nA:Because the Nate Temple series is a present day thrill-ride that takes no prisoners. Dragons, Angels, Demons, Greek Legends, Wizards, werewolves, and a whole slew of other supernatural 'Freaks' abound in my stories. My books have hit the top ten bestsellers list on Kindle for Urban Fantasy and Paranormal. The plot twists and turns until the last page, and my twisted sense of humor will have you laughing out loud at things you really shouldn't be laughing at. I mean, the first chapter depicts the legendary Hercules playing Beer Pong against Nate...

She never thought she would be tied up and forced to submit to their rules, and she never planned to find herself kneeling before their leader - no matter how gorgeous he was.\\nLucian had spent most of his adult life figuring out how to protect those banished by the corrupt men inside the city, but when he meets Emmie, he doesn't just want to keep her safe, he wants to claim her - body and soul. But once he does, and she despises him for it, how can he possibly show her what life can be like when she's really and truly free, and how can he show her that a good life might be possible with him?\\nIn 'Taken by the Enemy' readers are taken on a dark journey of discovery where the truths that Emmie has held close since she was a child are turned inside out, and she discovers that the enemy she's been raised to fear may just be her salvation. Will she be able to bend to Lucian's demands for obedience, and the harsh ways in which he enforces them, so she can discover a world where real peace is possible?

       "  'description': \"The Jungle Book meets Not Wanted On the Voyagein a triumph of storytelling and originality: a novel, as one character puts it, to make you believe in God.\\nPiscine Molitor Patel, nicknamed Pi, lives in Pondicherry, India, where his family runs a zoo. Little Pi is a great reader. He devours books on Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, and to the surprise of his secular parents, becomes devoted to all three religions. When the parents decide to emigrate to Canada, the family boards a cargo ship with many of the animals that are going to new zoological homes in North America, and bravely sets sail for the New World.\\nAlas, the ship sinks. A solitary lifeboat remains bobbing on the surface of the wild blue Pacific. In it are five survivors: Pi, a hyena, a zebra, an orang-utan and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger.\\nWith intelligence, daring and inexpressible fear, Pi manages to keep his wits about him as the animals begin to assert their places in the foodchain; it is the tiger, Richard Parker, with whom he must develop an inviolable understanding.\\nYann Martel's Life of Piis a transformative novel: a book to delight in, to talk about and treasure. It will convince the most jaded among us - and remind the rest - that something grander is afoot in our lives than we may have realized.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Random Magic: It\\'s a lot like our world, only...completely different. When absent-minded Professor Random misplaces the main character from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" young Henry Witherspoon must book-jump to fetch Alice before chaos theory kicks in and the world vanishes. Along the way he meets Winnie Flapjack, a wit-cracking doodle witch with nothing to her name but a magic feather and a plan. Such as it is. Henry and Winnie brave the Dark Queen, whatwolves, pirates, Struths, and fluttersmoths, Priscilla and Charybdis, obnoxiously cheerful vampires, Baron Samedi, a nine-dimensional cat, and one perpetually inebriated Muse to rescue Alice and save the world by tea time. Darkly comic (\"The Addams Family\", \"The Princess Bride,\" \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\") literary tale for intelligent readers; adults and in-betweens. Best for: Anyone with a sweet tooth for the eerily fantastic, book lovers, people who read in the bathtub, snuggled up in a favorite comfy chair, on trains, in tea rooms and under trees. Or Britcom addicts, closet romantics, deep thinkers who need a little light reading, and fun folks who just love a good story But also recommended for: Anyone who\\'s had a rough day and longs for the great escape, anyone who\\'s ever read and loved Alice in Wonderland, everyone who believes in everyday magic (or the other kind), smart folks, kind folks, and folks who prefer their -- rather offbeat -- humor black as coal. Advance reader pre-release reviews: * \"Brilliant! Roald Dahl meets Hayao Miyazaki\" * \"Alice in Wonderland meets Monty Python!\" * \"In [the] line of Pratchett or Adams\" * \"A delightful chase to locate Alice\" * \"Great dialogue\" * \"LOVED it\" * \"It\\'s Lewis Carroll and Roald Dahl and Monty Python and...it all works!\" * \"Zany, off-the-wall laugh riot\" * \"Inventive and fun\" * \"Vastly entertaining\" * \"Tomorrow\\'s classic, today\" * \"Sly dialogue...exquisite punning\" * \"Fun dialogue banter, constantly turning words on their head to make sense of the non-sensical. And the imagination involved in the scenery and the wild characters strewn throughout Henry\\'s journey are top notch, if perhaps drug induced\" * \"Amazing gift for dialogue, especially comedic dialogue\" * \"Wildly and wonderfully imaginative\" * \"Lots of fun\" * \"Quirky escape for children and parents\" * \"Extremely creative\" * \"Keeps building into funny, twisted nonsense!\" * \"An original spin on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales\" * \"The right director could have a field day with this\" * \"Thoroughly enchanting\" ...and \"madly in love w/this story.\" How it all began (First page): Prologue: In Which An Earl Vanishes, And Crumpets Appear \"You can\\'t declare anyone mad if they\\'re merely invisible.\" It\\'s been noted, of course, that quite interesting things happen on dark and stormy nights, particularly in castles. If you\\'ve a moment, perhaps you\\'d like to play a round of \\'let\\'s imagine.\\' You do have a fresh pot of tea handy, don\\'t you? You don\\'t? We\\'ll wait. Go on, then. Right. Comfy? Well, now, let\\'s imagine... It\\'s been the end of a long, hideous day. London is so trying. So noisy. So full of...of...too much of every sort of something. Lying on the couch, feeling completely out of sorts, you moan to the walls or anyone who happens to be passing that you\\'d trade your very soul for a teensy smidgeon of peace and quiet. Lo and behold, a rather lovely invitation arrives just at that moment, on a silver salver; a charming scrawl on impressively heavy linen cardstock, embossed with the family crest: Baron and Baroness Such-and-So request the pleasure of your company... Your presence, it appears, is in hot demand at a luxurious weekend soiree in the English countryside. Of course, you go...

       "  'description': \"The Darkness That Comes Beforeis R. Scott Bakker's first novel, the beginning of a large-scale, swords and magic fantasy trilogy. It's a book with historical depth by an author as interested in exploring the philosophy of his world as its violent, conflicted politics. The novel begins a bit slowly as we're introduced to the characters and the world they live in. There's Kellhus, a warrior-monk from a city hidden away for 2000 years, and Achamian, a sorcerer and spy from the Mandate school, whose members all have recurring nightmares of an ancient war. There's an emperor who longs for godhood, a barbarian warlord, and assorted other schemers. And lingering in the background is something truly evil.\\nWhen a newly arisen leader declares Holy War, the story brings everyone together. From that moment, the narrative takes off, and Bakker's prose carries the story right along. There's a fair amount of graphic violence, broken up by occasional flashes of humour. Bakker is working a combination that's currently also being explored by Steven Erikson and Sean McMullen: big fantasy worlds with long, deep histories, and characters who can think as well as act. It's a potent mix that elevates The Darkness That Comes Beforewell above most of its competition and bodes well for the rest of the series. --Greg L. Johnson\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Part of the Bestselling Series World The Immortal Ops by Mandy M. Roth\\nDr. James Hagen thought he'd bid Paranormal Security and Intelligence Agency good riddance nearly ten years back. He'd been an operative with them for so long that carving out a new path in life had taken time, but he'd achieved it. He'd made it his mission in life to help the wayward find a path again, to help those who couldn't help themselves. All that changed when he fell into enemy hands. Now, unable to fully heal and plagued by nightmares and choppy visions of what is to come, James isn't sure if he can keep going. That is, until he meets PSI's newest person of interest--a quirky, sexy cyberpunk who totally turns his world upside down.\\nLaney Steele knows she's onto something. It doesn't matter that most have written her off as a conspiracy theorist and a hacktivist. She knows the government is hiding the existence of super soldiers who can shapeshift into animals. She's so sure that she puts herself on the line to find out more, only what she uncovers isn't exactly what she was hoping for, and it has a heck of a lot more to do with her than she ever thought possible. When her newfound online gamer buddy turns out to be a super solider, she throws caution to the wind just for a chance to be with him. Neither one of them realize the enemy has been lurking, waiting for the perfect moment to strike--again.\\nDetails to come as soon as they're declassified.\\nPSI-Ops/Immortal Ops \\nAct of Mercy (B00I4BXYXC)\\nAct of Surrender (pre-order B00KFMRU5Q)\\nAct of Submission (coming Jan/Feb 2015)\\nAct of Security (coming 2015)\\nAct of Command\\nAct of Passion\\nImmortal Ops Series Books in order \\nImmortal Ops (B003WEAJ3O)\\nCritical Intelligence (B003WEAJ4S)\\nRadar Deception (B003WEAJ5C)\\nStrategic Vulnerability (B003VS0F76)\\nTactical Magik (B00HNYRHSE)\\nAdministrative Control (\\nB00JZWDCCC)\\nSeparation Zone (coming soon)\\nThis book is intended for adults only.\",\n",

It is here that the lives of two women, with two mysteries, will converge. Nineteen-year-old Night Vale pawn shop owner Jackie Fierro is given a paper marked 'KING CITY' by a mysterious man in a tan jacket. She can't seem to get the paper to leave her hand, and no one who meets this man can remember anything about him. Jackie is determined to uncover the mystery of King City before she herself unravels. Diane Crayton's son, Josh, is moody and also a shape shifter. And lately Diane's started to see her son's father everywhere she goes, looking the same as the day he left years earlier. Josh, looking different every time Diane sees him, shows a stronger and stronger interest in his estranged father, leading to a disaster Diane can see coming, even as she is helpless to prevent it. Diane's search to reconnect with her son and Jackie's search for her former routine life collide as they find themselves coming back to two words: 'KING CITY'. It is King City that holds the key to both of their mysteries, and their futures ...if they can ever find it.\",\n",

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll\\'s putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser,\" seemingly without moral or sense.\\nFor more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice\\'s new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the \"regular course\" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel\\'s illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll\\'s instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.',\n",

Here in this universe, Dorian Hawkmoon traverses a world of antique cities, scientific sorcery, and crystalline machines as he pulled unwillingly into a war that pits him against the ruthless and dominating armies of Granbretan. \\nAfter withstanding the power of the Black Jewel and saving the city of Hamadan from the conquest of the Dark Empire of Granbretan, Hawkmoon set off for Kamarang, where friendship and love await him.

Hawkmoon must rip this amulet from the neck of the Mad God if he hopes to save the city of Kamarang and free his friends and his one true love from the Dark Empire's relentless wrath.\",\n",

The desperation of Bastable's bizarre fate runs deep, for an unpredictable time warp thrusts him into strange worlds, all parallel to his own, and yet different. Throughout all this, Bastable can remain steadfast in his determination to reach his own time, because of his faith in one woman, inextricably bound to him in all dimensions of Time, and his belief in the existence of a secret Utopian citadel. But there is one thing that may have the power to come between Bastable and his goal-- a battle of Armageddon so horrifying in its believability that it almost obliterates his ability to keep searching.\",\n",

Putting them under her protection and that of the Hive, she meets Tobi, the elderly matriarch of the small herd who will sacrifice herself to save a human and in return is rewarded with the ultimate gift the Womb can bestow. As the bedraggled group race to the Hive for protection, saving a few desperate souls as they go, the first bomb arrives. As the survivors and the wildlife struggle to adjust to the new pecking order in the Hive and the revelations of their own origins, a woman and her two grandchildren live through the hellish horror and complete breakdown of civilization aboveground as they struggle to reach the Hive where her husband awaits. Horror visits the struggling survivors as they learn the Earth will not support habitation for at least another one hundred years. But the biggest shock comes from the Womb as it extracts a huge penalty from the hapless people, tolling the demise of the human race. Short synopsis - The bedraggled group race to the Hive for protection, struggling with the wildlife underground, as a woman and her two grandchildren live through the hellish horror and breakdown of civilization aboveground, after the bombs.',\n",

Purposefully, she invites the kids on a special mission to retrieve a hidden talisman under Mt. Diablo Elementary School. However, Mrs. White is not the only magician in town in search of the ancient artifact rumored to be a fountain of youth. She is aware that Mr. Stott, the not- so- ordinary ice cream truck driver, has a few tricks of his own.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Leon's never felt as strongly about any man as he does Andrew, but when Andrew asks to meet him for dinner, Leon's sure things are over before they've even started. Except Andrew isn't coming to dinner to call things off. He's coming to drop an entirely different bomb.\\nAndrew's a sorcerer. He can manipulate fire, he can manipulate lightning... but like most of his kind, what he can't do is maintain absolute control of his power when he's sexually aroused, which is dangerous to non-magics like Leon. No matter how much the two men want each other, there's no way around it: they're playing with fire, which means someone's bound to get burned.\\nAt first, they're both willing to back off, but as their feelings for each other deepen, their mutual desire is only getting stronger, and Andrew and Leon are hanging by a thread trying to resist each other. But can they give in without getting burned?\\nThis novella was previously published. 22,500 words.\",\n",

But that\\'s the way Zoey likes it. Because she has a secret ability even those closest to her don\\'t know: she can heal people by touching them. She discovered this power at a young age, but before she could ask her parents about it, her father died, and she was too late to help. How can she possibly tell anyone about her ability to heal when she didn\\'t save her father?\\nWhen twins Asher and Levi move to town, they shake up more than Zoey\\'s social life. Surprised by golden-boy Asher\\'s interest, she agrees to go on a date but ends up having to find another way home when things go wrong. Thankfully, despite being fairly menacing, Levi comes to her rescue.\\nZoey risks revealing her secret as she grows closer to both brothers--but she may just discover they have hidden abilities of their own...',\n",

ASIN is B00AGC6DQ2.***\\nShe will risk everything to save his life.\\nWhen seventeen-year-old vampire hunter Sloane McAllister went into the Red Sector to look for her brother, she never expected to meet vampire commander Aden Knight. She definitely never meant to fall in love with him. And she never thought she'd call the vampires her friends, or that to save them she would defy the one person she swore to always protect: her maniacal twin brother, Orion.\\nAfter thwarting her brother's plan to wipe out all vampires with a super virus, she thinks she may at last catch a break - until Aden grows ill, and she's thrown into prison for treason. But a jail cell can't compare to the thought of losing Aden forever. The brilliant vampire doctor Paris De Lange thinks she can manufacture a cure, but she'll need Orion's blood to do so. There's just one problem - Orion has escaped.\\nNow, if Sloane has any hope of saving Aden's life, she must travel to the surface and bring her brother to justice. But the White Sectors are far from safe. Revolution is brewing, and the control of the White Sector governments grows unstable as the Black Cross Guild creates anarchy in the streets, clashing with the Scarlet Guard and making them increasingly more aggressive. They do have one thing in common - they both want Sloane, dead or alive.\\nWith the world rising up against her, Sloane must rely on old enemies that become new allies, uncover the mysteries surrounding her heritage, and conquer her inner demons before the virus has time to claim the man who's stolen her heart.\",\n",

That\\'s because they had never seen a Gypsy funeral before, complete with rituals, incantations and a very special gold coin placed beneath the dead girl\\'s hands... -- During a chaotic gypsy burial service at the funeral parlor of Michael and Janet Savoy, a ritual gold coin is stolen from the corpse of the teenage daughter of an egomaniacal Roma gypsy chief. The theft unleashes a curse on the Savoys, unwitting unbelievers who come to realize their own five-year-old child is doomed to a gruesome death if they can\\'t unravel a foreign culture\\'s arcane mysteries in time to return the coin \"before rising of second sun [sic].\"',\n",

       "  'description': 'Twenty years ago, Terry Brooks turned fantasy fiction on its head with The Sword of Shannara, the first fantasy novel to make the mainstream bestseller lists, and the first in an unbroken string of thirteen bestselling books. Now, in Running with the Demon, Brooks does nothing less than revitalize fantasy fiction again, inventing the complex and powerful new mythos of the Word and the Void, good versus evil still, but played out in the theater-in-the-round of the \"real world\" of our present.\\nOn the hottest Fourth of July weekend in decades, two men have come to Hopewell, Illinois, site of a lengthy, bitter steel strike. One is a demon, dark servant of the Void, who will use the anger and frustration of the community to attain a terrible secret goal. The other is John Ross, a Knight of the Word, a man who, while he sleeps, lives in the hell the world will become if he fails to change its course on waking. Ross has been given the ability to see the future. But does he have the power to change it?\\nAt stake is the soul of a fourteen-year-old girl mysteriously linked to both men.

       "  'description': \"Angels dark and light have inspired Storm Constantine throughout her writing life. In Mythangelus, all of her stories with an angelic theme, or inspired by angel mythos, are collected for the first time. This includes two Wraeththu stories, 'By the River of If Only' and 'Paragenesis' - as the Wraeththu novels were originally inspired by magical angelic legends. Included too are 'Fireborn', and 'The Feet, They Dance', pieces that were written while Storm was working on her Grigori trilogy, which are tales inspired by the myths of the Fallen Angels and the Nephilim. 'A Change of Season' is the short story that eventually became the opening chapters of 'Stalking Tender Prey', the first in the Grigori series, and 'Heir to a Tendency' features the lead Grigori character of Peverel Othman, years before his feet led him to Little Moor and the events of the first novel. From the fairy tale lore of 'Spinning for Gold' and 'Living with the Angel' to the more science fiction oriented 'The Green Calling', and the dark urban fantasy of 'Return to Gehenna', these stories are among the most sumptuous and vivid from the imagination of the celebrated Shadow Priestess of Fantasy.\",\n",

But every turn leads her back to the one person she's determined to forget: Niccolo Medici. Not even the multitude of enchanted locks on the attic door trapping Nicco within can break their connection.\\nSensing Nicco calling to Adele, Isaac tries relentlessly to keep her from exploring paths too dark that would endanger them all. But a new threat is rising: the Medici's presence has attracted something else to New Orleans...an older enemy, one that will bring Isaac's haunted past to life, test the witches' friendships, and jeopardize Adele and Isaac's blossoming relationship.\\nIn this spellbinding continuation of The Casquette Girls saga, Adele must draw on the past--from seventeenth-century Florence, a time bubbling with alchemy and fraternal betrayal--and sort history from fantasy if she is to have any chance of saving her mother, her coven, and her magic.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Following his bestselling debut, Before I Wake, Robert J. Wiersema returns with this exquisitely plotted blend of supernatural thriller and domestic drama.\\nFor novelist Christopher Knox, getting up early every morning to write isn't bringing him the sense of fulfillment it once did. It's been ten years since his first novel was published, to some acclaim, and he's hit a wall in trying to write his next. His marriage to Jacqui isn't doing much better, and it's been months since he's slept anywhere but his office above the detached garage.\\nThe part of Chris's life that isgoing well, and brings him easy joy, is his relationship with his eleven-year-old son, David. While Chris may not make it to all of his son's ball games, their nightly ritual of reading together at bedtime not only helps David overcome his struggles with reading, but is a calm within the storm for them both, when their days are so full of challenges. And what better way for a novelist to connect with his child than through their mutual love of books, and a bedtime story routine as unwavering as Chris's love for his son.\\nWhen Chris comes across a book by one of his favourite childhood authors in a local used bookstore, he knows it will be the perfect gift for David's birthday. To the Four Directionsis not one Chris has read before, but he knows that Lazarus Took's adventurous, magical stories of young heroes and other realms would be just the thing for David, as they were for him. David is less than thrilled to receive a book he's never heard of before, however - he'd been hoping for The Lord of the Rings- and Jacqui is quick to see it as yet another sign of Chris's detachment from David's life.\\nBut once they start reading the novel together, David is completely enthralled, to the extent that he truly cannot put the book down. The story, of a young peasant boy who is plucked from his home by castle guards and sent on a quest for a mysterious Sunstone, makes David feel like he is right there, in the action. Even after his parents have to take the book away from him, he can't help but sneak it back to his room. As David is reading alone that night, he suffers an inexplicable seizure and falls into a state of unconsciousness. Doctors perform a barrage of tests, but cannot determine what's wrong. And as David's seizure recurs every night, his father learns that only one thing will calm it: being read to from his strange new book.\\nTrue to his nature, as someone with an inherent belief in the power of words, Chris becomes convinced that the secret of David's collapse lies within the pages of To the Four Directions. After failed attempts to find out more about Lazarus Took from his estate, Chris traverses the continent in search of the truth. Meanwhile, David wakes up within the story he has been reading - as the boy he has been reading about - and finds himself facing perils unimaginable, in a world that he soon realizes was created to capture the hearts and souls of children like him. Because he's not alone as he takes over the hunt for the Sunstone, but accompanied by those boys who have come before him. And as the quests of father and son lead them toward a fateful collision of worlds, David realizes that while he's not the first to fall victim to the book's horrific spell, perhaps he can prove himself strong enough to be the last.\\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\",\n",

An orphan of Davillon, she had somehow escaped destitution and climbed to the ranks of the city's aristocracy in a rags-to-riches story straight from an ancient fairy tale. Until one horrid night, when a conspiracy of forces--human and other--stole it all away in a flurry of blood and murder.\\nToday she is Widdershins, a thief making her way through Davillon's underbelly with a sharp blade, a sharper wit, and the mystical aid of Olgun, a foreign god with no other worshippers but Widdershins herself. It's not a great life, certainly nothing compared to the one she once had, but it's hers.\\nBut now, in the midst of Davillon's political turmoil, an array of hands are once again rising up against her, prepared to tear down all that she's built. The City Guard wants her in prison. Members of her own Guild want her dead. And something horrid, something dark, something ancient is reaching out for her, a past that refuses to let her go. Widdershins and Olgun are going to find answers, and justice, for what happened to her--but only if those who almost destroyed her in those years gone by don't finish the job first.\",\n",

Now I have a chance to do more than survive while building a better life for all Wilders. Unfortunately, it means doing the one thing I never believed I would do--joining with the demons I've always considered my enemies.\\nWorking with demons wouldn't be a horrible prospect except it means dealing with Corson. The irritating demon who manages to get under my skin until I'm not sure if I'd rather kill him or kiss him. The closer I get to him, the more memories of my long-buried past slip free, leaving me uncertain of what's real and what's not...or even of who I am.\\nCorson\\nI'd thought joining with the Wilders to hunt down the creatures that escaped Hell was a job I'd enjoy. Not only do I get to kill my enemies, but I also have a chance to get closer to Wren. I wasn't expecting the stubborn woman to go out of her way to avoid me.\\nCut off from our allies, Wren has no choice but to work with me. However, the more time we spend together, the more I realize that though she would prefer me dead, there's nothing I won't do to keep her safe. When a lethal new threat rises, I begin to fear keeping Wren alive may be impossible.\\n***The Hell on Earth series is a spin-off of the Road to Hell series. You do not have to read the Road to Hell Series to follow this series, but it is recommended that the Road to Hell Series be read first to avoid spoilers and to understand the characters better. Each book in this series will focus on different characters.***\\nDue to violence, language, and sexual content this book is recommended for readers 18+\",\n",

Some might call them supernatural, but for her they're just part of everyday life. What she knows about the supernatural would give most humans nightmares forever. Ridding the streets of bad-ass creatures of the night is Gabi's other job. Taking up the mantle of her father's legacy, she is a Hunter for the Malus Venatori. If she had a choice it would be her only job, but a girl has to make a living, right?\\nBeing ambushed and kidnapped by the sinfully sexy Master Vampire of the City should have been just another night on the job, except for the fact that Julius has other plans for her. When he reveals that his nemesis wants control of the City and has plans to fill it with Demons from the Etherworld, creating an army of Ghouls and turning humans into nothing more than cattle to feed his Clan, Gabi must choose her path. She must decide whether to join with Julius in a stand against the Demon Master or flee the City with her friends and family, leaving the Vampires to wage their own war and the rest of the residents to their fate.\\nBut it's not in Gabi's nature to back down from a fight, no matter how impossible the odds. As the Malus Venatori prepare for war, Gabi finds herself pulled deeper into Julius's world and makes some disturbing discoveries about her unusual supernatural abilities. Her existence might just be the answer to a mystery as old as the Vampire race. Even more unsettling than that is her undeniable attraction to Julius and the taste of his blood. But before she can come to terms with her conflicting desires they must all survive the Demon onslaught and find a way to safeguard the truth of her heritage.\\nWhile the supernatural bad guys know her as Angeli Morte, her friends call her Hellcat!\\nIf you like your heroine smart, sassy and absolutely kick-ass and your Vampire hero sexy as sin and twice as dangerous you're going to want to read the hellcat series.\",\n",

On his sixteenth birthday, he will take up Heritage, the magical sword wielded by his mother and generations of Gairden ancestors before him, and lead the kingdom of Torel into a new golden age of peace and prosperity. That's how his mother envisions his impending reign. Aidan prefers to see it as decades of sitting in an uncomfortable chair listening to old men bicker over property lines and taxes. If Aidan had his way, he would leave the sword and throne behind for a life free of responsibility. To Aidan's utter shock, Heritage grants his wish. In front of his parents and the entire kingdom, the sword rejects Aidan, leaving Torel without an heir. While Aidan struggles to find his place, an ancient evil awakens and provokes a war between Torel and the warrior tribes of the west. Thrust upon a bloody trail of deception and corruption, Aidan is forced to make a desperate choice: lead Torel in a war he does not believe in, or be banished from his home and family forever.\",\n",

As the second-born in her wolf clan, she came into this world owing a debt to the family of shape-shifting tigers who rule the Louisiana swamps in the Atchafalaya Basin. Kenyon is the only man she's ever wanted, the man who sets her blood on fire, but she's tired of being indebted to his family for something she didn't do. She wants him to choose her because he loves her, not because he owns her. When Kenyon's brother, Nik, is taken prisoner, Kenyon turns to Sage for help. Using her unique skills, she knows she can help him free his brother, but there will be a price. If she agrees to do this, she wants Kenyon to release her from her debt. However, the only thing Kenyon wants to do is hold on to her and never let her go.\\nPart 2 - Nik\\nAfter months of captivity as part of a roadside attraction, Nik Maddux is finally able to escape. Injured and at death's door, he makes his way through the swamp only to collapse near Juliette's home. Juliette pulls the naked man into her cabin and begins nursing him back to health, marveling at the black stripes which cover his body and the feline features of his face. She knows he's not quite human and realizes she may have found a kindred spirit, someone whose secrets are as deadly as her own. When Nik awakes, his attraction to Juliette is instant. While she heals his body, he wants to heal her soul. But danger is lurking in the swamp, and the longer they stay together, the more likely they are to lose everything.\",\n",

The opportunity to serve the Sugar Man--the massive creature who delights in delicious sugar cane and magnanimously rules over the swamp--is an honor, and also a big responsibility, since the rest of the swamp critters rely heavily on the intel of these hardworking Scouts.\\nTwelve-year-old Chap Brayburn is not a member of any such organization. But he loves the swamp something fierce, and he\\'ll do anything to help protect it.\\nAnd help is surely needed, because world-class alligator wrestler Jaeger Stitch wants to turn Sugar Man swamp into an Alligator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park, and the troubles don\\'t end there. There is also a gang of wild feral hogs on the march, headed straight toward them all.\\nThe Scouts are ready. All they have to do is wake up the Sugar Man. Problem is, no one\\'s been able to wake that fellow up in a decade or four...\\nNewbery Honoree and Kathi Appelt\\'s story of care and conservation has received five starred reviews, was selected as a National Book Award finalist, and is funny as all get out and ripe for reading aloud.',\n",

To be fair, it wasn't entirely her fault.\\nHer mentor, a 3,000-year-old vampire, destroyed Tucson police headquarters during a fight with a sorcerer. Footage of the fight went viral on the internet, and the existence of Preternaturals--vampires, witches, and other were-animals like Riley--was revealed. Humans went a little crazy. The Cats--and Wolves--were out of the bag, and only an act of Congress stopped the chaos.\\nBut not all the Preternaturals are happy with this new world order, however. The Queen of the Winter Faeries worries that exposing her hidden world will destroy it, and sends the nastiest storybook characters imaginable to kill Riley before she can out the Fair Folk, too.\\nThe Summer Queen, Winter's arch-rival, promises to protect Riley if she does her a teeny-weeny favor: break into Winter's castle, sneak past creatures straight out of Riley's nightmares, steal a magical mirror, and return it to Summer. All without Winter noticing.\\nRiley agrees to the favor--what choice does she have? But dealing with the Fae is always a double-edged sword, and the Summer Queen neglected to explain that if Riley successfully pulls off this heist, the entire world might end up on the edge of destruction.\",\n",

Told in alternating male and female perspectives, THE SHADOW SOUL has been hailed as \"an amazing start to a new series that is going to have people of all ages wanting so much more.\" (Happy Tails Tales Reviews)\\nWhen Jinji\\'s home is destroyed, she is left with nowhere to run and no one to run to--until she meets Rhen, a prince chasing rumors that foreign enemies have landed on his shores. Masquerading as a boy, Jinji joins Rhen with vengeance in her heart. But traveling together doesn\\'t mean trusting one another, and both are keeping a deep secret--magic. Jinji can weave the elements to create master illusions and Rhen can pull burning flames into his flesh.\\nBut while they struggle to hide the truth, a shadow lurks in the night. An ancient evil has reawakened, and unbeknownst to them, these two unlikely companions hold the key to its defeat. Because their meeting was not coincidence--it was fate. And their story has played out before, in a long forgotten time, an age of myth that is about to be reborn...\\nRAVE REVIEWS for THE SHADOW SOUL!\\n\"The writing is flawless. The story and plot line, and plot twists, had me captivated and enamored for the first words. I couldn\\'t put this book down for anything, and I absolutely cannot wait for book two...It\\'s an amazing start to a new series that is going to have people of all ages wanting so much more.\" - Happy Tails and Tales\\n\"One word to describe this book: intense! Everything from the battles, to the secrets, to the descriptions of the characters and scenery, are all incredibly intense. This book had me biting my nails, stomach tided in knots, and completely entranced til the last word.\" - Desert Rose Reviews\\n\"Throughout the story, the stakes were always raised. There was no part that lagged while Davis was telling her story of far off lands, and the drama continued to the very end...To those readers who like fantasy and adventure, or to those who tried to read \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" but couldn\\'t make it through the first chapter without falling asleep - this could be a series for you.\" - Pink Fluffy Hearts\\n\"The Shadow Soul was positively transportive, left me feeling refreshed, and renewed my faith in symbolism, imagery, and the importance of world building and cultural preservation...If you want to set out on a journey, read this.\" - We Do Write\\n\"I loved this book! I was drawn into the story with the fantastic and descriptive storytelling told alternatively between Rhen and Jinji!... The political pickings, magical murderers, and shadowy suspense are the real plot stars in this book and the wonderful characterization and world-building adds extra oomph to grab you and keep you in this world.\" - EBook Escapes\\nKeywords: teens and young adult, sword and sorcery, action and adventure, fantasy romance, coming of age, fantasy, teen fiction, dragons, magic, dual perspectives, free, freebie, free book',\n",

Living with a foster family just outside an American military base in Okinawa, Japan, she soon discovers that she is anything but normal. She learns she is an apparently immortal warrior, who has ties dating to ancient Egyptian times if not earlier.

The Realities are in danger--and from something more terrible than Mistress Jane and the mutated Chi'karda of the Thirteenth Reality. People from all Realities are unexplainably going insane. Worse, some Realities are fragmenting, disintegrating into nothingness. Master George has learned that Mr. Chu from the Fourth Reality is working on a mysterious new weapon called Dark Infinity.

Mistress Jane and Tick find themselves in a race to reach the weapon first--but who will destroy it and who will become its master?\",\n",

The city is dangerous, littered with discarded experiments from the Company--a biotech firm now derelict--and punished by the unpredictable predations of a giant bear. Rachel ekes out an existence in the shelter of a run-down sanctuary she shares with her partner, Wick, who deals his own homegrown psychoactive biotech.\\nOne day, Rachel finds Borne during a scavenging mission and takes him home. Borne as salvage is little more than a green lump--plant or animal?--but exudes a strange charisma. Borne reminds Rachel of the marine life from the island nation of her birth, now lost to rising seas. There is an attachment she resents: in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet, against her instincts--and definitely against Wick\\'s wishes--Rachel keeps Borne. She cannot help herself. Borne, learning to speak, learning about the world, is fun to be with, and in a world so broken that innocence is a precious thing. For Borne makes Rachel see beauty in the desolation around her. She begins to feel a protectiveness she can ill afford.\\n\"He was born, but I had borne him.\"\\nBut as Borne grows, he begins to threaten the balance of power in the city and to put the security of her sanctuary with Wick at risk. For the Company, it seems, may not be truly dead, and new enemies are creeping in. What Borne will lay bare to Rachel as he changes is how precarious her existence has been, and how dependent on subterfuge and secrets. In the aftermath, nothing may ever be the same.',\n",

Lower-class citizens have access to magic for the first time, while other Luminates lose theirs forever. Austria and Hungary are at odds once more.\\nAnna Arden did not know breaking the Binding would break the world.\\nAnna thought the Praetheria were on her side, content and grateful to be free from the Binding. She thought her cousin Matyas's blood sacrifice to the disarm the spell would bring peace, equality, justice. She thought her future looked like a society that would let her love a Romani boy, Gabor.\\nBut with the Monarchy breathing down her neck and the Praetheria intimidating her at every turn, it seems the conspiracies have only just begun.\\nAs threat of war sweeps the region, Anna quickly discovers she can't solve everything on her own. Now there's only one other person who might be able to save the country before war breaks out. The one person Anna was sure she'd never see again. A bandit. A fellow outlaw. A man known as the King of Crows. Matyas.\",\n",

While most residents of a tiny village regard those fireside stories as nothing more than cautionary tales meant to keep children in line, curious adolescents attempt to solve the puzzle of the haunted glade. Rumors of a strange twilight melody that seems to come from somewhere in the wood only feed youthful recklessness, and no one but the village potter knows the truth behind this mysterious music. He alone in his generation has heard the haunted glade's call, and he knows that someone among those young adventurers is now being summoned, as well. The task of finding that special boy and grooming him for his destiny falls on Irwin's shoulders.\",\n",

Only recently aware of the other world hidden behind our own, Kitara Vanders has barely scratched the surface of what being supernatural truly means. A special woman in her own right, she possesses unique telepathic abilities, gifts that have recently come under the scrutiny of the Acta Sanctorum, a fanatical organization whose mission is to cleanse the world of anything supernatural. Targeted and marked for death, Kitara's only hope lies with the lethally seductive yet emotionally scarred warrior Nicholas.\\nKnowing full well the atrocities of which the Acta Sanctorum is capable, Nicholas is all too eager for the battle to begin.

Despite his resolve to remain focused on his mission, a purely physical relationship binds them together in a way neither of them expected.

Now she finds herself on a Tour of the Queendom in search of her four Consorts - the four men whose Elemental magic will awaken hers.\\nHer First Consort, Fyre Lord Miach is all warrior. Her Second\\nConsort, Rayne Lord Dathan is all play. Bonding with Fyre and\\nRayne was almost effortless. Aire is giving her some problems -\\nmostly because his mother has him so sequestered that Temair\\nhasn't even caught a glimpse of the man!\\nWhen she finally does, Temair isn't at all prepared for what she\\nfinds. Instead of a stone cold fighter or a playful playboy, she finds a man scarred by life. Zevan needs more than Temair's love; he needs the love and support of the family she's building, too. Only by seeing himself through their eyes can he truly believe he's worthy to be Temair's Aire.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'In the slave city of Spire, Ellis has been discarded. His former master, a man who was supposed to teach him and take care of him, passed away, leaving Ellis alone and in danger of being taken to the Facility. Ellis is desperate to avoid that fate. He seeks a master to take him on, guiding him into adulthood as well as a profession. Ellis has had desire stolen from him--he\\'s been trained to blush, to submit, to give in. He doesn\\'t know how to cope with William, a man who wants the real Ellis.\\nWilliam is a Master, a man born in a neighbor city that does not deal in slavery. He has had bad experiences with slaves in the past, but all that changes when he rescues Harte, a young slave whose abusive master had all but destroyed him. Together, they are content in their mutual roles, not looking for anything more. But when Ellis catches the eye of Harte, and by extension, William, their relationship changes in ways for which they are unprepared.\\nHarte is a born submissive, a young man who lives for his role. He\\'s bratty but genuine. William, his master, is his entire life. Harte never expected to have room in his heart for another, but Ellis is beautiful and different and fills a place in his life that he hadn\\'t known was empty.\\nIf only Ellis could learn to ask for what he desired, what he needed, then maybe William and Harte could help him. But Ellis is trapped inside himself, insecure and afraid. To stay with William, he only has to ask...but that\\'s the one thing Ellis cannot do...\\nGenres: Gay / BDSM / Menage (M/M/M) / Group Sex / Voyeurism / Exhibitionism / Public Places / Contains Material That May Be Considered \"Dubious Consent\"',\n",

After gunning down more men than Billy the Kid--and being hung by a rope necktie for his crimes--the jolly, fast-drawing fugitive reckoned he'd earned himself a nonstop ticket to hell. Instead, he finds himself in Damnation: a gun-slinging ghost town located somewhere between heaven and hell.\\nThere are no laws in Damnation. Only two simple rules: If you get shot, you go directly to hell. If you stay alive without shooting anyone for one year, you just might get into heaven.\\nHardened outlaws pass the time in the saloon playing poker and wagering on who will get sent to hell next, while trying not to anger the town's reclusive vampire or the quarrelsome werewolves.

       "  'description': \"Listening Length: 782 Minutes\\nFor a select group of girls, the Glittering Court offers a shot at a life they've only ever dreamed of, one of luxury, glamour, and leisure. To high-born Adelaide, whose wealthy family is forcing her into a loveless marriage, the Glittering Court represents something else: the chance to chart her own destiny, and adventure in an unspoiled, prosperous new land across the sea.\\nAfter a chance meeting with the dazzling Cedric Thorn, Adelaide poses as a servant to join the crop of impoverished girls he promises to transform into proper ladies. But her familiarity with upper class life comes with a price: she must hide her identity from her new friends, mysterious refugee Mira and fiery former laundress Tamsin, and most importantly, from Cedric himself--even though she's falling in love with him.\\nEverything begins to crumble when Cedric discovers Adelaide's ruse, and she catches the eye of a powerful young governor, who wants her for a wife. She didn't leave the gilded cage of her old life behind just to become someone else's property. But nothing is as daunting--or as wonderful--as the potent, forbidden attraction simmering between Adelaide and Cedric. One that, if acted on, would make them both outcasts in a wild, dangerous, uncharted world, and possibly lead them to their deaths.\",\n",

In Odd Thomas he has created a character whose unique voice will live for generations to come. Odd Thomas takes pride in his work as a fry cook. His fame has spread, bringing strangers to the restaurant in Pico Mundo. Odd cannot say what it is that disturbs him about this particular stranger, but his sixth sense is alert ... This is a man with an appetite for operatic terror. The violence he craves is of the most extreme variety: multiple untimely deaths spiced with protracted horror. Tomorrow. Odd's fears are first for Stormy Llewellyn, his one true love. Stormy believes that our passage through this world is intended to toughen us for the next life -- that the many terrors we know here are an inoculation against worse in the world to come. But Odd Thomas knows more than Stormy about this world. Many people in Pico Mundo think he is some sort of psychic, perhaps a clairvoyant, a seer, something. None but a handful know that he sees the restless dead, those with unfinished business and, sometimes, plenty of postmortem rage. Tomorrow. The day begins as uncan\",\n",

They live a strongly traditional life, rich with story, music, dance, and magic, governed by the laws of the clan and the ways of the road. To the repressive Puritanical government of 17th century England, however, the gypsies are thieving, fortune-telling vagrants who are most likely allies of the devil.\\nSoon, a series of terrible events lands the family in jail, charged with murder. Emilia and Luka manage to escape, promising to bring back help and free them. But how? Emilia believes in the legend of the charms: it is said that the luck of the Rom soured after a long-ago gypsy matriarch broke her chain of charms, giving one charm to each of her five children. If they can gather the charms from the families, Emilia thinks, the strong magic of the Rom will somehow bring her family freedom. Luka, on the other hand, is more practical he wants to enlist the help of the other clans to help the Finches escape. Emilia and Luka must race through the countryside, navigating a hornets' nest of Rom-hating Puritans, Royalist spies, and traitors, if they are to complete their quest before the magistrate delivers a death sentence\",\n",

With women becoming scarce, it\\'s necessary to trade the offworld Divinity Corporation for brides.

That is, until he sees Lilith, the bewitching woman sent by the gods to reward-or punish?-him.Lilith, a data analyst for Divinity, is betrayed by the Corporation and wakes up in a primitive, uncharted dimension filled with warriors who know only war and duty. Her fear of becoming a sex slave to a big, beefy knight becomes all too real when a warrior of god-like proportions claims she\\'s his new woman. As Lilith discovers, there are worse fates than being the focus of Sorin\\'s skillful and earthy seduction.',\n",

Magic intensifies, spreads and goes public.\\nGOVERNMENTS REGULATE MAGIC. LA Tribune, 9.0.2\\nDanger from Dark Magic swells. Politicians panic.\\nTen years ago the world was shaken with the discovery that White and Black magic existed. Despite the headlines, like most people, nothing magical has happened in Sig's life.\\nAs he prepares to leave for college, mysterious Great-Grampa Thor shows up with injuries sustained in a battle with a Dark Wizard. He bestows upon Sig, his only male heir, a magical family heirloom.\\nHe's to lead in the fight against Dark Magic. Unfortunately, Sig can only access a small portion of the talisman's power. His only magic is the ability to change into a 9 foot tall, 700 pound warrior. It's small benefit in the age of machinery, rockets, and computers.\\nThe Dark Wizard comes after Sig. He escapes, but Great-Grampa falls victim to a demon induced coma before he can teach Sig what he needs to know.\\nSig joins with a group of fellow supernaturals. His new friends help him fight off more attacks while he searches desperately for his greater magic. If he can't stand on his own against a Dark Wizard, how can he take his place at the front of the world's fight against black magic?\",\n",

The great raven, Wark has died, and the citizens elect Brighton Aviamore the new Chancellor. The Falcon Rider's first challenge is to stop the mysterious winds that are growing worse by the day. But when Willowmena is kidnapped by a monstrous bird, and Brighton discovers she's been taken to a land called Amaraka, he abandons all other concerns, and swears an oath to get her back. Forced to traverse the dimensions of time and space, and reincarnate in a new body, Brighton is reborn in Kansas shortly after the end of the American Civil War which has been won by the South. An elitist mob of Rutheneist tycoons (part zombie, part vampire) are destroying the earth out of greed, and the same winds ripping apart Perpetua are driving humanity underground. Brighton grows up to be a brilliant inventor and aviator. He attends the finest steam technology university in the country where students race single-man steam jets in a city filled with a bewildering array of Babbage-steam driven vehicles, airships, and other inventions. Joined by Will, Pello, and Biffee (also incarnated as humans), Brighton discovers the winds are originating from an oceanic whirlpool that's being fueled by manmade disruptions to the environment. Though determined to find a solution, he faces a series of devastating traumas including Will's murder. Assisted by a small army of robots, he constructs an enormous levitating platform in the shape of a falcon to carry a reverse-ionization device over the sea and restore balance to the discordant atmosphere. His nemesis, Dredgemont has also incarnated in America, and sets out to destroy him by raising an army of phantom gorpes, trolls, and bats, including Gretch and Malgor. A clash of spirit armies takes place amidst the global hurricane and the Skookumchuck whirlpool threatens to swallow Brighton and his fantastic airship to the bottom of the sea.\\nFALCON LORD -- A SERIES OF STEAMPUNK FANTASY NOVELS\",\n",

According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch(recorded, thankfully, in 1655, beforeshe blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world's last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.\\nExcept that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon -- each of whom has lived among Earth's mortals for many millennia and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle -- are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they've got to find and kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he's a really nice kid). There's just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him. . . .\\nFirst published in 1990, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's brilliantly dark and screamingly funny take on humankind's final judgment is back -- and just in time -- in a new hardcover edition (which includes an introduction by the authors, comments by each about the other, and answers to some still-burning questions about their wildly popular collaborative effort) that the devout and the damned alike will surely cherish until the end of all things.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Simon Grant has an unlikely friend in Professor Moira Ananke, whom he met while visiting the museum where she works. One day, while looking through dusty bookshelves he comes upon a series of black, leather journals. He quickly becomes engrossed in reading her accounts of archaeological excavations: digging at Ramses' tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings in 1995, excavating ancient Indian cities at Harappa in 1986. His attention is drawn to a dozen more journals stretching along the bookcase: Field Notes from the Discovery of Tutankhamen's Tomb, 1922, Finding Troy, 1871, Work with Johannes Burkhardt, 1812. Simon glances toward his mentor who silently watches him take down several books and scan their pages. They are what they appear to be--her personal notes from excavations stretching back nearly 200 years. So begins Simon's introduction to time travel. Professor Ananke is a Master Time Traveler. She agrees to accept Simon as her apprentice, to teach him the secrets of time travel. After a few brief practice trips, Simon feels he is beginning to learn the tricks of this dangerous business. But one day, while photographing a mysterious medieval manuscript, he is grabbed and thrown through time under no control of his own. Simon lands, shaken and confused, in a medieval wood in Yorkshire, England. He is discovered by a young lady, Bryn Berengar, who involves him in a dangerous and suspenseful mystery tied to the murder of Thomas Becket. Their search for the manuscript that provides clues to the mystery exposes them to many dangers, including being poisoned by monk's hood, locked in a tower room with a corpse, and fighting a desperate knight with a secret to hide. They travel to Carlisle Castle to thwart a plot to overthrow King Henry II and Simon finds the fencing lessons he took at the local youth bureau take on great importance as he fights for his life. Perhaps most dangerous however, is the relationship he is developing with Bryn.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Blue Bamboois a collection of seven short stories by one of Japan\\'s preeminent postwar writers and prose stylists, Osamu Dazai. Not the typical romantic fantasies so often seen in Japanese writing, filled with water sprites and vengeful ghosts, these stories are a mixture of fantastic allegory, slightly skewed fables, and affecting romantic tales. Revealing the wide range of Dazai\\'s imaginative powers, they also give a glimpse of his humane and idealistic side.\\nFrom the title story, about an impoverished, henpecked scholar who is transformed by the love of a voluptuous bird, to \"The Chrysanthemum Spirit,\" about a passionate gardener who meets a brother and sister with extraordinary powers, Dazai creates a world of fantasy and romance that is infused with his own psychological concerns. Many readers may recall the poignancy of Oscar Wilde\\'s The Happy Princeor Han Christian Andersen.\\nThe collection is capped by two delightful stories-within-a-story, in which the assorted members of a quirky family compose alternate episodes of a slightly gothic romance with hints of Poe and Saki (in \"On Love and Beauty\") and a wildly elaborate retelling of Rapunzel that is engaging, horrifying, and touching by turns (in \"Lanterns of Romance\").\\nAll in all, these warm, inventive, and life-affirming stories will strike a deep, satisfying chord in many readers.',\n",

Yet when he's finally able to open his eyes to what might be his fate, it could be too late.\\nAs a submissive wolf of her Pack, Mandy Calhoun has always only watched Gibson from afar. Because of her fears, she hasn't let her intentions toward him--or the other in her sights--be known.\\nOliver Dare is the Foreseer of the Ursine Pack, and knows with each vision, his death is that much closer. Yet he cannot see his own future--or that of the two wolves who have been thrust into his path.\\nThere is danger lurking in the den, and as the three learn to process their emotions and navigate their temptations, they'll have to fight for something they never knew they had--or sacrifice it all for a purpose far greater than their own destinies.\\nShadowed\\nSinclair, Alpha of the Unseen Pack, is determined to destroy the Shifter Accommodation Unit. He understands that his people will never be free until the truth is revealed and their enemies are brought out of the shadows and exposed to the public. Unfortunately, the human female who has been secretly working with him has disappeared, and his priorities must shift slightly. He's resolved to track her down, and not just because she has the information he needs.\\nMira Reese isn't stupid. She's painfully aware that the sexy shifter she's been working with has been using her fascination for him to gain access to the CDC computer system. But that doesn't stop her from helping Sinclair. Not when it allows her to be close to him. But after the CDC kidnaps her, she realizes that this isn't a game. She's a potential savior for the future of the shifters--and perhaps especially the loner wolf who stirs her passions.\",\n",

Life before she had a relentless thirst for blood... life before she became a vampire.\\nAll Bree knows is that living with her fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself, and above all, make it home by sunrise or die.

She so longs to have fun adventures of her own filled with daring plots and danger, but those dreams are as far away as a dream could be.\\nBut her life quickly becomes filled with real danger when she meets a very suave and charming young man named Lucius Knight. Well, that, and the tiny vicious little monsters called Sea-Merrows that tried to drown her, a slightly egocentric Irish youth who can manipulate fire, and blood-thirsty vampires tracking her across the country. Not to mention the indestructible beings called Hollows that want to kidnap her by the orders of their undead master, Byron Barrowite. Other than that, she has nothing to worry about.\\nImogen's life just became a lot more interesting, and if she can just survive the giant dragon made of pure fire, she may learn just how much she enjoys getting into trouble.

She had no idea they were so dangerous.\\nBoston, 1891. Sophia Tims comes from a family of explorers and cartologers who, for generations, have been traveling and mapping the New World--a world changed by the Great Disruption of 1799, when all the continents were flung into different time periods. Eight years ago, her parents left her with her uncle Shadrack, the foremost cartologer in Boston, and went on an urgent mission. They never returned. Life with her brilliant, absent-minded, adored uncle has taught Sophia to take care of herself.\\nThen Shadrack is kidnapped. And Sophia, who has rarely been outside of Boston, is the only one who can search for him. Together with Theo, a refugee from the West, she travels over rough terrain and uncharted ocean, encounters pirates and traders, and relies on a combination of Shadrack\\'s maps, common sense, and her own slantwise powers of observation. But even as Sophia and Theo try to save Shadrack\\'s life, they are in danger of losing their own.\\nThe Glass Sentenceplunges listeners into a time and place they will not want to leave, and introduces them to a heroine and hero they will take to their hearts. It is a remarkable debut.\\nThis audiobook includes a PDF of maps from the book.\\n\"I think The Glass Sentence is absolutely marvelous. It\\'s the best book I\\'ve read in a long time. The world-building is so convincing, the plot so fast-moving and often surprising, and the ideas behind the novel so completely original. I love this book.\"--Nancy Farmer, National Book Award-winning author of The House of the Scorpion\\n\"I loved it! So imaginative!\"--Nancy Pearl\\n\"An exuberantly imagined cascade of unexplored worlds, inscribed in prose and detail as exquisite as the ... maps young Sophia uses to navigate such unpredictable landscapes. A book like a pirate\\'s treasure hoard for map lovers like me.\"--Elizabeth Wein, New York Timesbest-selling author of Code Name Verity\\n\"Brilliant in concept, breathtaking in scale and stellar in its worldbuilding; this is a world never before seen in fiction . . . Wholly original and marvelous beyond compare.\"--Kirkus Reviews, starred review\\n\"A thrilling, time-bending debut . . . It\\'s a cracking adventure, and Grove bolsters the action with commentary on xenophobia and government for hire, as well as a fascinating system of map magic.\"--Publishers Weekly, starred review',\n",

       "  'description': \"When Jane is invited to spend her summer vacation with her new--but admittedly odd--friend, Staffa, it feels like a dazzling daydream. Jane is lured by the promise of beautiful gowns as delicate as cobwebs, fancy parties as elegant as castle balls, and more fun than she can possibly imagine.\\nBut there's something menacing about the gleam in Staffa's mother's eyes. Something not-quite-right about the long drive over the hills of Scotland. Something strangely alluring about the mysterious, glowing box she is told she must never open. Never, ever, for any reason . . . Until, of course, it is opened on her behalf.\\nIf Jane goes home with Staffa--if she enters the world of the box--will she be trapped forever? Or will she become every girl's secret idea of a princess?\\nKate Saunders takes readers into a wildly imaginative miniaturized world of castle balls, death-defying bee riders, and giant racing spiders. A world where wicked plots are hatched, exciting rescues staged, and where the power of friendship can be a match for even the most dastardly of villains.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"First published in 1865, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland began as a story told to Alice Liddell and her two sisters on a boating trip in July of 1862. The novel follows Alice down a rabbit-hole and into a surreal world of strange and wonderful characters who constantly turn everything upside-down with their mind-boggling logic and word play, and their fantastic parodies. Carroll's fable illustrates his masterful ability to weave logic with nonsense in a tale that continues to delight all ages.While this great classic is widely available, the Broadview edition is unique. Richard Kelly combines Alice's Adventures in Wonderland not with the later (and largely distinct) work Through the Looking Glass but rather with Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Carroll's first version of the story. Readers are thus able to trace the literary revisions, and to compare Caroll's own illustrations in the original with the famous John Tenniel illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Among the many other materials included in the Broadview Literary Texts edition are a substantial selection of early reviews, selections from Carroll's diaries and correspondence, Carroll's early nonsense poems, and the originals of the poems parodied in his text.\",\n",

Years later, amid the crumbling ruins of his home, a pair of travelers find his diary and its horrifying details of the terrors that stalked his world -- grotesque, swine-like monsters crawling from an abyss to swarm about the doors, fierce storms that threatened to unleash malevolent supernatural powers, and a harrowing vision of the death of the solar system.\"A classic of the first order,\" declared H. P. Lovecraft of this hugely influential novel. First published in 1908, it bridges the era between traditional ghost stories and modern fantasy. Modern readers will savor its compelling journey through space and time and its evocative blend of the best aspects of horror and science fiction.',\n",

Things might not always be easy, but at least she gets to call all the shots and follow her own heart. That is until Jack Pensione, irritatingly gorgeous billionaire playboy and CEO/heir to the family empire shows up at her diner with an ultimatum: find $3 million to purchase the space, or vacate so it can be turned into condos.\\nBut Kate isn't going down without a fight. So when Jack offers a third option--marry him, and he'll gift her the space--she agrees, knowing it'll save the life she's built for herself and her brother, and that the marriage will be over practically before it's begun. After all, it's not as if she actually likes Jack, or as if he's actually attracted her at all... Little does she know he's also a werewolf, that he's vying to be the alpha of his pack, and that her problems are just getting started.\",\n",

He would never be worthy of the woman of his dreams, never achieve great deeds of valor and never be remembered in song or story. He would spend every day very much the same as the days of his apprenticeship in the village counting house tallying other people's coins acquired from other people's wealth garnered from other people's deeds until his never-exceptional life came to a never-exceptional end.\\nIt wasn't that he was without dreams. He dreamed them every night; of rescuing the imperiled Caprice Morgan from some terrible rampaging monster or of protecting the virtuous Caprice Morgan from marauding pirates who had somehow come up the river or of returning from a great Quest beyond the village boundaries laden with treasure that he could lay at the feet of the appreciative Caprice Morgan.\\nBut each morning he awoke in his straw bed and knew he was just Jarod Klum\\nUntil, that is, the coming of the Dragon's Bard.\\nEdvard the Just ... Dragon's Bard to the Dragonking Khrag ... blew into Eventide on a late winter wind that some said he created out of his own seemingly inexhaustible supply of words. He swept up Jason with his words and turned the apprentice's world upside down.\\nThe Dragon's Bard convinced Jarod to win his fair Caprice through 'heroic deeds of a more manageable scale' - setting Jarod on a course of misadventures that turns the town on its head. Jarod's single-minded pursuit of his greatest wish - even if it is a broken one - escalates until the only thing left for him to do is to become a dragonslayer and save the town from a ferocious, legendary monster that everyone fears but no one has ever seen.\\n'Eventide' is brought to life through the stories of the interweaving lives of its citizen characters, their follies, joys, tragedies and triumphs on a scale of life to which we can all relate. In the end, it is a visit to a place where we ourselves would like to settle down and live out our lives as we should.\\n'Eventide' centers around Jarod Klum - a young apprentice to his father's counting house - and his heart-sore pursuit of his beloved Caprice Morgan, one of three down-on-their-luck sisters who are struggling to keep a broken wishing well supplied with wishes. His attempts at heroics more often result in calamity and raise the ire of nearly the entire town, but with the help of the DragonBard, the kind friendship of the dwarven smithy and the guidance of a farmer with a mysterious past, Jarod will be victorious - even if it means luring a dragon into the town.\\n[Description and coverart from dragonsbard.com; used by permission, 28 May 2010.]\",\n",

For once she's looking for lust, not love. What she hadn't planned on was coming face to face with an old obsession.\\nTall, dark, and oh-so-handsome werewolf Grayson West is well versed in the arts of war and women. He's got one week to blow off steam before he heads out on his next mission and he's more than willing to help a lady find her inner vixen.\\nEspecially when she's the same beautiful blue eyed vamp he met one hundred years ago and has never been able to forget. They were once sworn enemies, pulled apart by war. Now they're lovers. But history has a way of rearing its ugly head and their new relationship will have to stand up to the test of loyalty, friendship and even time itself.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Is the bond between mother and daughter unbreakable, even by death? Julia Severn is a student at an elite institute for psychics. Her mentor, the legendary Madame Ackermann, afflicted by jealousy, refuses to pass the torch to her young disciple. Instead, she subjects Julia to the humiliation of reliving her mother's suicide when Julia was an infant. As the two lock horns, and Julia gains power, Madame Ackermann launches a desperate psychic attack that leaves Julia the victim of a crippling ailment.\\nJulia retreats to a faceless job in Manhattan. But others have noted Julia's emerging gifts, and soon she's recruited to track down an elusive missing person--a controversial artist who might have a connection to her mother. As Julia sifts through ghosts and astral clues, everything she thought she knew of her mother is called into question, and she discovers that her ability to know the minds of others--including her own--goes far deeper than she ever imagined.\\nAs powerful and gripping as all of Julavits's acclaimed novels, The Vanishersis a stunning meditation on grief, female rivalry, and the furious power of a daughter's love.\\nFrom the acclaimed novelist HEIDI JULAVITS, a wildly imaginative and emotionally intense novel about mothers, daughters, and the psychic damage women can inflict on one another.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Some Kind of Fairy Tale is a very English story. A story of woods and clearings, a story of folk tales and family histories. It is as if Neil Gaiman and Joanne Harris had written a fairy tale together.\\nIt is Christmas afternoon and Peter Martin gets an unexpected phone call from his parents, asking him to come round. It pulls him away from his wife and children and into a bewildering mystery. He arrives at his parents' house and discovers that they have a visitor. His sister, Tara. Not so unusual you might think, this is Christmas after all, a time when families get together. But 20 years ago, Tara took a walk into the woods and never came back - and as the years went by with no word from her, the family, unspoken, assumed that she was dead. Now she's back, tired, dirty, dishevelled, but happy and full of stories about 20 years spent travelling the world, an epic odyssey taken on a whim. But her stories don't quite hang together, and once she has cleaned herself up and got some sleep, it becomes apparent that the intervening years have been very kind to Tara. She really does look no different from the young women who walked out the door 20 years ago.\\nPeter's parents are just delighted to have their little girl back, but Peter and his best friend, Richie, Tara's one-time boyfriend, are not so sure. Tara seems happy enough, but there is something about her... a haunted, otherworldly quality. Some would say it's as if she's off with the fairies. And as the months go by, Peter begins to suspect that the woods around their homes are not finished with Tara and his family....\\nBritish narrator John Lee has read audiobooks in almost every conceivable genre, from Charles Dickens to Patrick O'Brian, and from the very real life of Napoleon to the entirely imagined lives of sorcerers and swashbucklers. He has won numerous Audie Awards and AudioFile Earphones Awards, and he was named a Golden Voice by AudioFile in 2009. Lee is also an accomplished stage actor and wrote and co-produced the feature films Breathing Hard and Forfeit.\",\n",

A heroine with a keen mind for catching killers and a soft heart for bad boys, Charlie is back in this third sizzling paranormal romance thriller.\\nHER LAST WHISPER\\nMadness and murder invaded Dr. Charlotte Stone\\'s life when she was just a girl--and made her a woman determined to save others from the horror she survived. An expert in the psychology of serial killers, she\\'s faced down more than her share of human monsters. But Charlie can also communicate with the spirits of those who die violently, an extrasensory skill that has helped the FBI bring lethal predators to justice. Now, after narrowly escaping death a second time, Charlie\\'s ready to step away from the edge . . . before her luck runs out.\\nToo bad Charlie is too dedicated for her own good--and too devoted to federal agent Tony Bartoli to say no when he asks her to ride shotgun on yet another risky mission. Of course, she already has her hands full with Michael Garland: the handsome, roguish ghost with whom she\\'s hopelessly in love--a spirit who depends on Charlie to keep him from slipping forever into the dark side of the afterlife. But in the mortal world, beautiful single women are vanishing from Las Vegas hotels at night. All signs indicate that a psychopath is on the prowl in Sin City, and Bartoli\\'s FBI colleague Lena Kaminsky has reason to fear that her missing sister may be just the killer\\'s type.\\nIn a town full of fast players and few rules, flushing out a smooth-talking stalker like the Cinderella Killer might be a loser\\'s game. But for Charlie, the only way to cage her quarry is to plunge back into the homicidal hell she vowed to leave behind--and may not leave alive.\\nPraise for Her Last Whisper\\n\"A tightly written ghostly romantic suspense novel with intriguing supernatural elements and sizzling sexual tension.\"--Kirkus Reviews\\n\"An absolute winner . . . explodes with both passion and mystery . . . a tale that will haunt you, providing both thrills and chills.\"--Bookreporter\\n\"Outstanding . . .

Secrets are hidden in the eternal twilight of the trees. Those secrets emerge into light when Brian disappears in the forest, as his father did three decades before. His father, however, came home with no memory of the events in the depths of the forest. What has drawn Brian away? Will he emerge, shuddering and broken, as his father did, or will the forests close around him, as they have done so often before?',\n",

       "  'description': 'Fantasy is a creation of the Enlightenment, and the recognition that excitement and wonder can be found in imagining impossible things. From the ghost stories of the Gothic to the zombies and vampires of twenty-first-century popular literature, from Mrs Radcliffe to Ms Rowling, the fantastic has been popular with readers. Since Tolkien and his many imitators, however, it has become a major publishing phenomenon. In this volume, critics and authors of fantasy look at its history since the Enlightenment, introduce readers to some of the different codes for the reading and understanding of fantasy, and examine some of the many varieties and subgenres of fantasy; from magical realism at the more literary end of the genre, to paranormal romance at the more popular end. The book is edited by the same pair who produced The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction (winner of a Hugo Award in 2005).',\n",

But why do the humpback whales sing? That's the question that has Nate and his crew filming, charting, and recording every whale that crosses their path. Until one day when a whale lifts its tail to display a message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite Me....\\nNo one has ever seen such a thing; not Nate's longtime partner, not world-renowned photographer Clay Demodocus, not their saucy young research assistant, Amy, not even spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman, Kona. And when the film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot--and their research facility is trashed--Nate realizes that something very fishy is going on.\\nIt only gets weirder when a call comes in from Nate's big-bucks benefactor, saying that a whale has phoned her, asking for a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye. Suddenly the answer to the question that has driven Nate throughout his adult life is within reach. And it's not what anyone would think.\",\n",

Before long, Han finds himself in possession of a secret believed to be lost to history, a discovery powerful enough to unite the people of the Fells. But will the secret die with him before he can use it?\\nA simple, devastating truth concealed by a thousand-year-old lie at last comes to light in this stunning conclusion to the Seven Realms series.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Imagine for a moment that you are a dangerously clever, thoroughly over-educated sixteen year old, who feels wholly disconnected from her current station in life and hates her father. Imagine also that you have the further misfortune to find yourself alive during the 13th Century, that your father is the philistine King of a small Central European country, and that he does not approve of the fact that you can quote Aristotle more expertly than you can curtsy. Finally to top everything off imagine that you have just learned that you are to be married off to a German nobleman who believes that you will make an excellent pawn in an ongoing struggle to become Holy Roman Emperor...\\nWhat do you do?\\nIf your name is Aletheia--first and only daughter of his Royal Highness Edward IX, and most indubitably born in the wrong century--you proceed to flee. If your name is Aletheia you also find yourself embarking on a bizarre and comic odyssey across perilously chaotic medieval Europe. During her journey our heroine will encounter cross dressing Romanians, bamboozle criminally incompetent highwaymen, crush spherically odious tutors (using only the power of pure logic), and, in at least one desperate instance, impersonate the Virgin Mary, all in the hopes of reaching a final destination that is about to be sacked by an army of waylaid Crusaders...',\n",

When it became clear that they could not win, all of the fairies moved belowground--except the 8th family, the demons. Rather than surrender, the used a magical time spell to take their colony out of time and into Limbo. There they have lived for decades, preparing to exact revenge on humans.\\nNow, the tainted time spell is unraveling, and demons are beginning to materialize without warning on Earth. If humans were to find out about them, all fairies would be exposed. To protect themselves, the fairies must predict when the next demon will materialize. But in order to do so, they will have to decipher temporal equations so complicated, even a great brain like Foaly can't understand them. But he knows someone who can: Artemis Fowl.\\nSo when a very confused demon imp appears in a Sicilian theater, Artemis is there to meet him. But Artemis is not alone. There is someone else who has unlocked the secrets of the fairy world and managed to solve complex mathematical problems as only a genius could. And she is just twelve years old...\\nFrom ISBN 0739336800 / 9780739336809\\n8 hours, 24 minutes / 7 CDs\",\n",

She has the ability to take over the entire Gargoyle Kingdom, if she is willing to kill the king. However, looking to prevent takeover, Truce transforms Madeline, thereby granting her the ability to achieve the thing she wants most--death--if she can just find the human recipient for the Gargoyle Gift that she now has to give.

Now, only a voyeur in the life of The Boy with the Golden Rod Voice, Madeline's must reconcile her own life and death, if she ever hopes to have free reign of her soul.\",\n",

Disowned as a child by parents who did not approve of his gifts, Stephen struck out on his own and, along the way, became a highly sought-after psychic. Between his own private clients and the consulting work he does for Revelations, business has never been better. If only his love life was meeting with as much success. Despite his efforts to reach out and enjoy the dating scene, his heart remains drawn to only one man--Maddox Blackwood.\\nAlpha of the Pontiac wolf pack, Maddox Blackwood is the only man Stephen has ever met who has the power to destroy him. Their initial meeting led to a rejection of epic proportions that left Stephen wary of any kind of romantic entanglement. Now, eight years later, Maddox is back and ready to claim Stephen as his own, as he should have done all those years ago. The only question is, can Stephen find it in himself to forgive the past and accept the future Maddox is offering?\\nAll thoughts of mating are put on the back burner when Revelations receives a call for help from a local cougar pride. People are dying, but are their deaths as mundane as they appear or is something more nefarious plaguing the Pride lands? With their investigation underway, Stephen and his team soon discover that things aren't always what they seem, and just because you don't see something, doesn't mean it isn't hunting you.\\nAbout JJ Black\\nBorn and raised in Western Michigan, JJ Black's love affair with books started young and has only grown with age. Always a fan of supernatural fiction and romance, JJ stumbled across the M/M genre and has never looked back.\",\n",

As a teen, it was the most devastating day of her life, because it took Gerri away from Wen, the boy she'd loved since childhood. Fifteen years later, that boy has become a gorgeous man straight out of her wildest fantasies--and when he requests to meet her, Gerri suspects just seeing him will set her up for heartbreak all over again.\\nThe petite blonde he fell for as a young VampLycan is still beautiful--and all human. Though Gerri's always been the one he longs to be with, Wen can't mate her. After the death of his brother, Wen was forced to assume the duties of firstborn, which include mating another VampLycan. But he needs a human to pull off his current mission for his clan, hunting a rogue Vampire in a human city.

We hear that the house has gone all to sixes and sevens since we left it, but that's going to be remedied now'\\nYoung Kay Harker lives in an old house in the country, filled with portraits of his ancestors. His only companions are his unpleasant guardian Sir Theopompus and his governess Sylvia Daisy Pouncer (who, Kay suspects, has stolen all his toys). Life is lonely and dull, until one night Kay's great-grandpapa Harker, a sea captain, steps out of his portrait to tell him about a stolen treasure that belongs to Kay's family. The evil Abner Brown is searching for it too, but Kay is helped by the midnight folk: creatures like Nibbins the cat and Rollicum Bitem Lightfoot the fox, and even his lost toys, who will join him on his dangerous quest.\\nThe Midnight Folk is a feast of imaginative story-telling, a glorious cornucopia of pirates and witches, lost treasure and talking animals. Although it was published in 1927, it evokes an older world: houses are lit by oil lamps, and travel is by horse, carriage - or broomstick. Masefield perfectly captures a child's perspective, from the terrors of tigers under the bed to the horrors of declining a Latin adjective. Yet there is also plenty of humour that adults will appreciate, from Miss Piney Trigger, who swigs champagne in bed and prides herself on having backed a host of Derby winners, to Kay's lessons: 'Divinity was easy, as it was about Noah's Ark. French was fairly easy, as it was about the cats of the daughter of the gardener.' This mingling of past and present, reality and fantasy, has made this one of the most rewarding and influential children's books ever written.\",\n",

The magical creatures have learned to use their wings and are growing into their regal inheritance. Their humans, too, are changing. As the mystical bonds with their dragons deepen, Thymara, Tats, Rapskal, and even Sedric, the unlikeliest of keepers, have begun transforming into beautiful Elderlings raked with exquisite features that complement and reflect the dragons they serve.\\nBut while the humans have scoured the empty streets and enormous buildings of Kelsingra, they cannot find the mythical silver wells the dragons need to stay health and survive. With enemies encroaching, the keepers must risk \"memory walking\"- immersing themselves in the dangerously addictive memories of long-deceased Elderlings - to uncover clues necessary to their survival.\\nAnd time is of the essence, for the legendary Tintaglia, long feared dead, has returned, wounded in a battle with humans hunting dragon blood and scales. She is weakening and only the hidden silver can revive her. If Tintaglia dies, so, too, will the ancient memories she carries - a devastating loss that will ensure the dragons\\' extinction.',\n",

In this book, Keel leads the way into this mysterious realm, postulating that what we know--or, rather, think we know--about UFOs & their ilk is in need of serious reconsideration. The possibilities Keel has uncovered through his years of research are controversial, to say the least; what he has to say will undoubtedly infuriate or alienate (excuse the pun) many readers. This is most unfortunate, since Keel is only trying his best to make sense of what seems at times a senseless matter indeed, perpetuated by some eternally manipulative & elusive intelligence.

       "  'description': \"A girl who's always been in the shadows finds herself pursued by the unbelievably attractive new boy at school, who may or may not be the death of her. Another girl grows up mute because of a curse placed on her by a vindictive spirit, and later must decide whether to utter her first words to the boy she loves and risk killing everyone who hears her if the curse is real. And a third girl discovers that the real reason for her transient life with her mother has to do with belonging -- literally belonging -- to another world entirely, full of dreaded creatures who can transform into animals, and whose queen keeps little girls as personal pets until they grow to childbearing age.\\nFrom a writer of unparalleled imagination and emotional insight, three stories about the deliciousness of wanting and waiting for that moment when lips touch.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"EXCERPT (FROM CODENAME: NIGHT WITCH):\\nSigrid had been trained since childhood for moments exactly like this. She was made to survive. But all her training, all the shouted words of her instructors, abandoned her. She couldn't focus on anything, she couldn't concentrate, and it was going to get her killed. She didn't even see the gully until she tripped and fell into it, rolling down the embankment. But it was enough to shake away the fog. That, and the sound of alarms blaring behind her.\\nScores of men were emerging from the facility's entrance behind her. Soldiers. A hunting party. Then she heard something else: barking.\\nDogs. They had bloody dogs.\\nGlancing back, she saw the search beams and heard their shouts. From somewhere behind her, hidden amongst the trees, an air vehicle was sent aloft. Sigrid glanced skyward. Thunderhawks. She counted three of the heavy gunships rising above the canopy of pines. Two of them rumbled toward her and then past, close enough for her to feel the heat of their thruster wash blast over her.\\nShe hadn't even remembered cloaking. It was perhaps the only thing that saved her.\\nThe third Thunderhawk stayed back. It hovered above the soldiers, moving with them. Belly-mounted floodlights illuminated the woods, lighting their way. They'd be scanning for her. She could only hide so long. She had to move; she had to stay ahead.\\nLost, alone and armed only with the stolen knife, Sigrid did the only thing she could. She ran.\\nSYNOPSIS:\\nThe unthinkable has happened. Sigrid Novak, the most dangerous and wanted person in the history of the Federation of Corporate Enterprises, has been captured. For the women of New Alcyone--women just like her, genetically reengineered and trained since childhood to be the most effective killers in the galaxy--this is a staggering loss. For the Independents, the rebels who captured her, this is a boon beyond measure.\\nIf they can figure out how to control her.\\nNow, six years have passed since the events of Bellatrix, and for six years Sigrid Novak has been gone, vanished, with no sign, no word and no trace. But all has not been quiet within the Federation. The Council for Trade and Finance has been murdered, assassinated, and the death toll among the Federation's ruling elite continues to rise.\\nWith every corporate enclave that falls, the legend grows. They call her the Night Witch. A champion to some, a nightmare for others. Wherever she goes, death is soon to follow.\\nThen, in an abandoned CTF research facility--and after so many years lost--a woman awakens. Her name is Sigrid Novak. And she is very, very angry.\",\n",

But for as long as she can remember, she's suffered from seizures. And in recent years they've consumed her life. To Emery they're much more than seizures, she calls them loops--moments when she travels through wormholes back and forth in time and to a mysterious town. The loops are taking their toll on her physically. So she practically lives in the hospital where her scientist father and an ever-growing team of doctors monitor her every move. They're extremely interested in the data they collect when Emery seizes. It appears that she's tapping into parts of the brain typically left untouched by normal human beings.\\nEscaping from the hospital, Emery travels to Esperanza, the town from her loops on the upper peninsula of Michigan, where she meets Asher Clarke. Ash's life is governed by his single-minded pursuit of performing good Samaritan acts to atone for the death of a loved one. His journey is very much entwined with Emery's loops.\\nDrawn together they must unravel their complicated connection before it's too late.\",\n",

Having reached the limits of what was technically possible in the universe, the Bruwnan had crafted a new reality for themselves outside the dimensions of Euclidean space time, a virtual reality, but a reality none the less. The city was built on the inside of a sphere. Within it, and free from physical form and its associated frailties, the Bruwnan concentrated on the exploration of science and art.\\nThat was more than half the age of the universe ago. All scientific notions and forms of art had been explored, abstracted, resurrected and recycled many times. There was nothing left to explore and complacency had descended on the Bruwnan. Valheel had lost is vibrancy, it was a city of immortals that felt dead.\\nAmantarra couldn\\'t remember which came first, the sense of constriction that the city now gave her or the feeling that something was fundamentally wrong. It was when her father first voiced his concerns that people were disappearing that brought about the realisation that they were slowly and secretly being wiped out. Something had found a flaw in immortality.\\nThree hundred thousand years ago her sister had set out to do something about it. That was the last they\\'d heard from her. Now, after many years of experimentation, it was Amantarra\\'s turn to pick up the gauntlet. Her first act of aggression buys the time she needs to create a weapon of unimaginable power. But despite her efforts to remain hidden, the fight follows Amantarra to Earth where it all starts to go horribly wrong.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Morgeth\\'s iron grip on the land of Ilyria is beginning to reach beyond its borders; his necromancy is ripping apart the very fabric that binds Alatheia together and the only thing that stands the way of total domination is an ancient elven prophecy.\\nInheriting his mother\\'s sword, Eran must journey far beyond his idyllic farm life to find a ring that once belonged to his father and bring together the two heirlooms in order to destroy the evil that threatens to engulf Ilyria. He joins with others ordained by the prophecy; a legendary warrior, a shape-shifting mage, an elf haunted by his own past and two rather unlikely individuals. Together they face insurmountable obstacles and tragedy before coming face to face with evil itself. \\'Necromancer\\' is the first in the series of books called \"The Dark Rising\".\\nFrom the author:\\nI will be the first to admit that \\'Necromancer\\' is NOT the most original piece of epic fantasy literature ever written. I took a lot of inspiration from Tolkien\\'s \\'Lord of the Rings\\' and other great fantasy books (including those of Terry Brooks and Brent Weeks); I wanted to write a story that contained all the elements from my favorite books...one that I would like to read myself.\\nNecromancer was a side project; something I wrote just for fun without any intent to publish it (although it ended up published anyway). It was a lot of fun to write, and though some people may not like it because it is familiar, I enjoyed the time I spent doing it.\\n(edited by author)',\n",

The second is that she periodically vanishes into thin air.\\nUsually, Eva's spontaneous disappearances last only a few minutes, but on the day of her high school graduation, she vanished for nearly ten years. For a decade she was invisible and intangible--unable to be felt or seen or heard. She can't imagine a worse torture than standing on the outside looking in.\\nNow she's back, but it's not enough to be tangible once again. Eva needs to find a way to stop vanishing permanently. Which is why she's facing her ten-year class reunion--and her ex-boyfriend. The clue to stopping her disappearances must be tied to him, intertwined with their past. Unfortunately, approaching him is awkward-level five billion, considering he broke up with her ten years ago.\\nWhen Eva starts getting threatening texts from an unknown source, she realizes the reunion has just gotten even more complicated. Especially when she discovers that source has found out about her second, worse secret.\\nIn order to find the key to stop her vanishing, Eva must battle grudge-wielding friends, relentless old crushes, and a classmate with a vendetta against her. And, in the meantime, hope she doesn't vanish again. Because somebody wants her gone for another ten years.\\nVanish is a sweet romance with a fantastical twist. It's the perfect blend of Magical Realism and Romance.

       "  'description': 'In a huge, dark forest somewhere in the north, a round, rather simple hedgehog called Pork emerges from a pile of leaves in the night... and sets in motion this powerful - and unusual - collection of animal stories for adults.\\nThere is mystery and terror in the great woodland, and there is love. It is a world where fear and death and the survival of the fittest are the pitiless underlying themes. Though they are loosely linked, the stories are written to be read as separate tales, usually with a single main character: an ugly, love-lost squirrel, a wantonly savage stoat, a bat, a veteran hare running before the hounds. They are suspense thrillers or romantic interludes, pure adventure narratives, even horror stories; they all draw us deep into the stern forest through the elements we share with the animals - cold and dark, rain and sun, suspicion, loyalty, the need for warmth and the safety of shelter - above all, the feeling that, even in a world where death is inevitable, there is always enough to make life worth living.\\nThe style is clear, straightforward, often very simple, but there is passion as well as knowledge in the book. It brings the wild creates fiercely to life, in a disturbing way, with menace and unease - but vividly, in a literary debut of great imaginative strength.',\n",

       "  'description': \"In 1865, English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), aka Lewis Carroll, wrote a fantastical adventure story for the young daughters of a friend. The adventures of Alice--named for one of the little girls to whom the book was dedicated--who journeys down a rabbit hole and into a whimsical underworld realm instantly struck a chord with the British public, and then with readers around the world. In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters. In many ways, this sequel has had an even greater impact on today's pop culture than the first book.\",\n",

He learns these would-be killers belong to a predatory alien species, the Dalthin, who enslave worlds telepathically and that he has been engineered to perceive these invaders in order to direct the world against them. But when his mother murders his father, the land descends into chaos and his task may prove impossible. Struggling to accept what he has learned, Regilius flees Ydron, hoping to devise a strategy.\\nReluctant to slay the one who gave him life in order to assume the throne, but convinced his mother must fall, the young prince enlists allies against her. As armies collide, he realizes only a fundamental change can remedy the troubles plaguing the land--ills his family has caused--and he struggles with his hereditary destiny. Set in a vast and varied land where telepaths and those with unusual mental abilities tip the course of events, Awakening goes to the heart of family, friendship and betrayal.',\n",

Looking for a new world to call their own, they brought with them a rich melange of cultures, religions, and dialects from a far-off planet called Earth. Mighty were the old-fathers, with the power to shape the world to their liking--but that was many generations ago, and what was once known has long been lost. Steamboats and gas-filled blimps now traverse the planet, where people once looked up to see great silver cities in the sky.\\nLike his world, John deBrun has forgotten more than he remembers. Twenty-seven years ago, he washed up onto the shore of Nanagada with no memory of his past. Although he has made a new life for himself among the peaceful islanders, his soul remains haunted by unanswered questions about his own identity.\\nThese mysteries take on new urgency when the fearsome Azteca storm over the Wicked High Mountains in search of fresh blood and hearts to feed their cruel, inhuman gods. Nanagada's only hope lies in a mythical artifact, the Ma Wi Jung,said to be hidden somewhere in the frozen north. And only John deBrun knows the device's secrets, even if he can't remember why or how!\\nCrystal Rainis the much-anticipated debut novel by one of science fiction's newest and most promising talents.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Magical machines, wizards, witches, mysterious underworlds, a race against time - and two most magical girls.\\nAnnabel Grey has been brought up to be a very proper Victorian young lady. But being 'proper' isn't always easy - especially when you can sometimes see marvellous (as well as terrifying) things in puddles. But parlour tricks such as these are nothing compared to the world that Annabel is about to enter...\\nAfter the rather sudden departure of her mother, Annabel is sent to live with her aunts. They claim to be Shoreditch witches, and from a very old family line of them too. They're keen to introduce Annabel to their world of transformation, potions and flying broomsticks (which seem to have strong personalities of their own) but are horrified when Annabel announces not only does she not know any magic, young ladies shouldn't believe in such things. But before Annabel has time to decide whether she does or not, she is swept into an urgent quest.\\nThe trees of Highgate have been whispering to Kitty - an extraordinary urchin of a girl, who Annabel's aunts seem very fond of - and so have the fairies. They talk of a terrible, dark magic that wants to devour all of London. And of a most magical girl who might be able to stop it . . .\\nThis sparkling and enchanting story is sure to bewitch you, so curl up in front of the fire, and prepare to be swept away . . .\",\n",

The two classes, Blacks and Blues, have to wear bracelets to identify one another and are not allowed to socialize with one another or they will be put into the tower. William Moore is of the Black group and in charge now. He only has one daughter that he has kept a secret. Now that Jamie has just turned eighteen she won't be a secret for long.\\nJamie Moore and her best friend Emily go to a club for her birthday. It isn't the kind of club her father would approve of.

A man with a pierced eyebrow, a lip ring and rich chocolate brown hair catches her eye and she is taken by surprise; after a night together she hopes he wears a black bracelet as she does.\\nWhen a new butler starts at the Moore's residents, Jamie is told to stay in her room, but the new butler calls her downstairs. When Jamie realizes it is her Henry from the night before working as the butler, her heart is broken. She now knows they can't be together or her father would have him killed.\\nBut what if they could keep their relationship a secret? Could their love beat all the odds against them?\",\n",

There's no question about claiming her, and when he spots her entering an exclusive BDSM club, he believes it's Fate. Summer can't get past the foyer without a master--and that master will be him.\\nAt the sound of Jubal's voice, she knows he's the one, the man she's been looking for, the master who can demand her devotion.

Thanks!***\\nMichael \"Hatch\" Jacobson is hired muscle and damn good at his job. Since the existence of Vampires was revealed on earth, humans and blood drinkers have lived in peace. Because each side has abided by a strict set of rules. But rules get broken, and now Hatch is putting his muscle to use working with the blood-bag drinking Daybreakers to keep a rogue faction of vamps from feasting on humans.\\nLola Sommers works at a local blood bank. Her job allows her to support a cause dear to her: providing sustenance for the vamps who value human life. Her unique heritage opens her heart to their plight, but it\\'s a human that catches her attention and makes her want a future like the stories her grandparents shared about true love. Back when shifters and witches existed. Before blood was a commodity and humans sat a little lower on the food chain.\\nWhen Lola is put in the crosshairs of a Daybreaker war, Hatch will risk it all to protect what\\'s his.',\n",

Her scale of success--with her at the bottom--only goes as high as that college degree she never got, until she gets one hell of an epiphany from a Trinity Corporation public-relations guy who calls himself Jude. He tells her she's the Lamb of God, and it's time for that whole Second Coming thing.

It doesn't matter that Rain's a conflict-avoiding lesbian and Jude is history's worst traitor. They're all that stands between humanity and an end of the world that wasn't supposed to happen.\",\n",

Ever since it was published in 1843 it has had an enduring influence on the way we think about the traditions of Christmas. Dickens\\' other Christmas writings collected here include \\'The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton\\', the short story from The Pickwick Papers on which A Christmas Carolwas based; The Haunted Man,a tale of a man tormented by painful memories; along with shorter pieces, some drawn from the \\'Christmas Stories\\' that Dickens wrote annually for his weekly journals. In all of them Dickens celebrates the season as one of geniality, charity and remembrance.\\nThis new selection contains an introduction by distinguished Dickens scholar Michael Slater discussing how the author has shaped ideas about the Christmas spirit, an appendix on Dickens\\' use of The Arabian Nights,a further reading list and explanatory notes.',\n",

Humans and dragons have existed side by side since nearly the beginning of time--surely their desires must have crossed at some point.\\nLike a Breath of Flame: Erotic Tales of Dragons contains nine short stories that explore the theme of scaled sensuality from a variety of different perspectives. In this anthology are stories of lonely mountain dragons with exotic tastes, dragons with the power to slip into their lover\\'s dreams, shapechanger dragons, unusual interpretations of the term \"dragon rider,\" dragon-as-devil and dragon-as-god... and, yes, no less than two versions of the virgin-sacrificed-to-dragon story, each with their own unique twist on the tale.

But when a request for a Great Wizzard arrives in Ankh-Morpork via carrier albatross from the faraway Counterweight Continent, it's he who's sent as emissary. Chaos threatens to follow the impending demise of the Agatean Empire's current ruler. And, for some incomprehensible reason, someone believes Rincewind will have a mythic role in the war and wholesale bloodletting that will surely ensue. (Carnage is pretty much a given, since Cohen the Barbarian and his extremely elderly Silver Horde are busily formulating their own plan for looting, pillaging, and, er, looking wistfully at girls.) However, Rincewind firmly believes there are too many heroes already in the world, yet only one Rincewind. And he owes it to the world to keep that one alive for as long as possible.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Jack is back, for 2002. F. Paul Wilson\\'s engaging, self-employed, off-the-books fixer, Repairman Jack, returns for another intense, action-packed adventure just a little over the border into the weird, in The Haunted Air. First introduced years ago in the bestseller The Tomb, Jack has been the hero of a series of exciting novels set in and around New York City including Legacies, Conspiracies, All the Rage, and Hosts. \"Repairman Jack is a wonderful character, ultracompetent but still vulnerable. Wilson strolls into X-Files territory and makes it his own, keeping the action brisk and the level of suspense steadily rising,\" said the San Francisco Examiner & Chronicle.\\nIn Astoria, Queens, the lively ethnic neighborhood just across the river from Manhattan, a house is being haunted by the ghost of a nine-year-old girl in riding clothes. More than two decades before, she\\'d been abducted from stables in Brooklyn. Now it\\'s up to Jack to uncover the truth of her story and liberate the pretty, blond spirit. Perhaps the answer is in the odd little store called the Shurio Coppe? Ah, but that would be telling.\\nJack does things no human being should be able to do, but we watch, in horrified fascination, as the forces of evil seem about to triumph and fill the world with eternal darkness. And then-- but you must read the book.\\nAt the Publisher\\'s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.',\n",

After all, he has the ability to see into the future, and his friend Chloe can walk through walls. But before either of them can master their Tan'ji--their talismans of power--a new threat looms over all Keepers, and they must prepare to battle their eternal enemies--the Riven.\\nFar away, drawn by an irresistible summons, a mysterious girl is making her way to the Warren, the Keeper stronghold. She wears the Ravenvine and is learning to wield its fascinating power; but this Tan'ji is damaged. There's no telling what will happen to the instrument or its Keeper if it cannot be made whole again. April's journey is long and dangerous, with strange new companions at her side and a pack of sinister hunters tracking her. Will she reach the Warren in time, and is it a safe haven, or will it offer only more danger?\\nTed Sanders's magical series began with The Box and the Dragonfly and continues with this powerful sequel that expands the extraordinary world of the Keepers, where nothing is ever ordinary and three words rule: Curiosity. Discovery. Possibility.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"GHOSTLY RIDERS\\nKarigan G'ladheon had been a Green Rider, one of the king of Sacoridia's elite magical messengers. Being a Green Rider was more perilous than Karigan had ever imagined, for a rogue Eletians had cracked the magical D'Yer Wall which had protected Sacoridia for a thousand years from the evil influence of Blackveil Forest--the arboreal prison of Sacoridia's ancient enemy Mornhaven the Black--and had brought the threat of dark magic into the land. In the messenger service she had been caught up in a world of deadly danger, and though she had defeated the Eletian, she had nonetheless been tainted by his wild magic.\\nExhausted in body and spirit, and determined to be the mistress of her own destiny, Karigan has returned to her home in Corsa. But Karigan's determination was no match for the Rider's call. Ghostly hoofbeats echoed in the deep regions of her mind, and when she awoke to find herself on horseback halfway to Sacor City--in her nightgown--she finally gave in.\\nBack at court Karigan found the Green Riders weakened and diminished. Rider magic was becoming unreliable, and she herself was having ghostly visions--visions of a strong woman with wild flowing hair and a blue and green tartan draped across her shoulder, pinned with a golden brooch. This woman was no stranger to Karigan nor would she have been to any Green Rider, for she was Lil Ambriodhe, First Rider, and founder of the Green Rider corps. But why was she appearing to Karigan? And would Karigan be able to seek the help of a woman who had been dead for a thousand years?\",\n",

       "  'description': 'To celebrate DAW Books\\'s 30 years of publishing in the sf and fantasy genres, Wollheim and Gilbert have assembled these volumes that feature authors who have published under the DAW banner and whose works have made significant contributions to the field of imaginative literature. An essay by the editors (repeated in both volumes) relates the history of DAW and its founders, Donald and Elsie Wollheim, while individual author or editor commentaries introduce many of the stories. The fantasy collection includes a variety of stories, including Mercedes Lackey\\'s expression of an author\\'s worst nightmare (\"After Midnight\") and Christopher Stasheff\\'s melancholy parable of a wizard\\'s journey of bitter self-discovery (\"Coronach of the Bell\"). Contributions by other notable fantasy writers such as Tanith Lee, Melanie Rawn, and Lynn Abbey round out this collection of 18 tales. The sf anthology collects a stellar group of stories, including Brian Aldiss\\'s cautionary tale of a space-faring warship whose passage results in the death of civilizations (\"Aboard the Beatitude\") and Tad Williams\\'s wry recounting of the chat room at the end of the world (\"Not with a Whimper, Either\"). Stories by authors including Frederik Pohl, Timothy Zahn, and Kate Elliott are also among the 19 selections in this well-balanced volume. Together or separately, both books are recommended for most libraries.',\n",

       "  'description': 'On her long journey home from school after a fight which will surely lead to her expulsion, Karigan G\\'ladheon ponders her future as she trudges through the immense forest called Green Cloak. But her thoughts are interrupted by the clattering of hooves as a galloping horse bursts from the woods, the rider slumped over his mount\\'s neck, impaled by two black-shafted arrows. As the young man lies dying on the road, he tells Karigan that he is a Green Rider, one of the legendary messengers of the king, and that he bears a \"life and death\" message for King Zachary. He begs Karigan to carry his message, warning her not to read it, and when she reluctantly agrees, he makes her swear on his sword to complete his mission \"for love of country.\" As he bestows upon her the golden winged-horse brooch which is the symbol of his office, he whispers on his dying breath, \"Beware the shadow man...\"\\nKarigan\\'s promise changes her life forever. Pursued by unknown assassins, following a path only her horse seems to know, and accompanied by the silent specter of the original messenger, she herself becomes a legendary Green Rider. Caught up in a world of deadly danger and complex magic, compelled by forces she cannot understand, Karigan is hounded by dark beings bent on seeing that the message, and its reluctant carrier, never reach their destination.',\n",

This is the twelfth expedition.\\nTheir group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.\\nThey arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers--they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding--but it's the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything\",\n",

Her discoveries there are the stuff of romantic legend, catapulting her from scholarly obscurity to worldwide fame. The details of her personal life during that time are hardly less private, having provided fodder for gossips in several countries.\\nAs is so often the case in the career of this illustrious woman, the public story is far from complete. In this, the fourth volume of her memoirs, Lady Trent relates how she acquired her position with the Royal Scirling Army; how foreign saboteurs imperiled both her work and her well-being; and how her determined pursuit of knowledge took her into the deepest reaches of the Labyrinth of Drakes, where the chance action of a dragon set the stage for her greatest achievement yet.\",\n",

But it is something else--something evil--and it tricks Becket into opening a doorway to another realm, letting a darkness into our world, a corruption that begins transforming Philadelphia into a sinister and menacing version of itself...but only at night.\\nThe changes are subtle at first, causing Becket to doubt her senses and her sanity. But soon the nightmarish truth is impossible to deny: By day, the city is just a city, but at night it literally comes alive with malevolent purpose. Brick and steel become bone, streetlights turn into gallows, and hungry alleys wait to snare mortal victims. Terrified citizens huddle indoors after dusk, as others succumb to the siren song of the night, letting their darker sides run wild.\\nOnce, Becket's biggest problems were living up to her police commissioner father's high expectations and a secret crush on her best friend's boyfriend. Now she must find a way to survive and protect her loved ones...before the darkness takes her as well.\",\n",

The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins--a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.\\nGabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father\\'s gifts, have always protected themselves by living \"off the Grid\"--that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.\\nSummoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula--ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms--one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.\\nMoving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own. John Twelve Hawks\\'s stunningly suspenseful debut is an international publishing sensation that marks the arrival of a major new talent.\\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\\nFrom the Publisher (Random House)\\nLength 15:32:30',\n",

Then, much to her surprise, she is selected as the new charity student at Iverson, an elite boarding school on England's southern coast.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll\\'s putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\" There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser,\" seemingly without moral or sense.\\nFor more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully non-moralistic, non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice\\'s new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the \"regular course\" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel\\'s illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll\\'s instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.',\n",

As he stands alone in the dark and feeling sorry for himself, he hears a lone harmonica being played in the distance. The sound is deep and powerful, and something in the music draws him away from his doorway and into an old alley where the homeless gather around garbage-can fires. In that alley, Brandt meets the harmonica player, Wally, an old black man who can play the music that Brandt dreams of--the blues. Not the blues as you hear them on the modern radio, but they way they were once played--filled with an extra \"something\" that can\\'t be taught. Despite Wally\\'s warning, Brandt begs the old man to teach him the songs he is playing, and in the ensuing encounter, Brandt is gifted--or cursed--with new abilities. He feels the pain building up around him and inside him. Not his own pain, but the pain of others, the pain of those who have passed away, the pain of those who died with no one to hear their stories. Wally explains it. The music will release the pain, and it is the only thing that will release the pain. Brandt must play, or the pain will build up inside until he destroys his own mind from the weight of it. He becomes a conduit for the pain of the world, and then he is left alone. Brandt plays one last concert with his band, and his performance draws them all, audience and musicians alike, into another world. They witness a panorama of pain and horror, and Brandt plays it up and out of himself, then walks away from the bar and the band, leaving them to wonder what just happened.\\nWhat follows are a series of revelations, one for each member of the band, and one for a young girl named Liz, drawing them together, and ultimately reuniting them with Brandt. Together, Brandt, Sinthia, Shaver, Dexter and Liz take off to the mountain town of Friendly, California for a date with pain, destiny, and a silver haired Reverend who would like to see them dead.\\nIn the final showdown, they must meet the challenge of the music, the pain, and their mingled histories and stand, or fall, with the pain of the world in the balance.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Harry Middleton is born in an America staggered by a century of decline, a time of medical and technological marvels beyond the reach of most people in a shattered economy. Pessimism and despair are more common than optimism and hope, and a desperate government bets the future on space. The lunar and Martian colonies have not provided the hoped-for salvation, so despite an angry, disillusioned public, the first star mission will soon be launched.Harry is a special child, smart, precocious, his only confidante an embittered grandfather. When the old man dies, Harry is lost, until he meets Lorrie. At thirteen, they bond, certain they'll spend their lives together, but a year later, she disappears, and Harry is desolate.\\nWith help from his friend Carlos, Harry begins a quest to find her, but he quickly learns how powerless he is. Even the police lack the resources to help. Harry and Carlos can only depend on themselves and each other. An unlikely duo, Harry is an academic prodigy while Carlos is a stud athlete. Realizing that school and baseball are their tickets out of the morass they're caught in, they inspire each other to greatness in both.\\nTrying to move on with his life, Harry has a college sweetheart, but as long as Lorrie haunts him, he knows the relationship is doomed. He gains celebrity and wealth, but the thing Harry wants most, finding and saving Lorrie from whatever fate took her from him remains beyond his reach. And always, in the background, are the deteriorating state of the country and the coming star missions.\\nAnd of course, there's the Portal.\",\n",

Now she is a Spoken Word artist and the top act for Warriors of Light Records. But come nightfall, she hunts vampires and demons--predators that people tend to dismiss as myth or fantasy. But Damali and her Guardian team cannot afford such delusions, especially now, when a group of rogue vampires have been killing the artists of Warriors of Light and their rival, Blood Music. Strange attacks have also erupted within the club drug-trafficking network and drawn the attention of the police. These killings are a bit out of the ordinary, even for vampires. No neat puncture marks in the neck to show where the life's blood has been sucked from the body. These bodies have been mutilated beyond recognition, indicating a blood lust and thirst for destruction that surpasses any Damali has encountered before. Damali soon discovers that behind these brutal murders is the most powerful vampire she has ever met, and this seductive beast is coming for her next. But his unholy intentions have also drawn the focus of other hellish dark forces. Soon Damali finds herself being pulled deeper into the vast and horrifying vampire world.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"When a Chinese gang hits Sunnydale, racial tensions in the community are sparked. Buffy has seen the baddies shake down Willy the Snitch, so naturally her Slayer senses are up. But to Willow, the situation poses a more personal threat. Her new friend Jia Li has been feeling the backlash from this cross-cultural hostility -- and it's tearing her family apart. Jia remains true to her ancient cultural heritage, but her brother, the angry, outspoken Lok, is ready to toss out old Chinese customs for the modern American lifestyle. And he's willing to use the occult for just that purpose.Suddenly, a beautiful martial-arts warrior arrives on the scene. It's impossible to tell where her allegiance lies, but Xander -- whose romances are becoming habitually complicated -- is smitten, Giles is in full research mode, and before long, Buffy is wondering who's behind the gang warfare. Is supernatural evil brewing?\\nThis novel is non-canon.\",\n",

If Djal doesn't figure out how to stop Julian's obsession with him, he just might strangle the man.\\nJulian has lived through hell, more so than most people know.

       "  'description': \"Ripley Todd just wants to live a quiet, peaceful kind of life. Her job as a sheriff's deputy keeps her busy and happy, and she has no trouble finding men when she wants them - which, lately, isn't all that often. She's perfectly content, except for one thing: she has special powers that both frighten and confuse her, and though she tries hard to hide them, she can't get them under control. Distraction soon arrives in the handsome form of Mac Allister Booke - a researcher who's come to investigate the rumours of witchcraft that haunt Three Sisters Island. Right from the start, he knows there's something extraordinary about Ripley Todd. It's not just her blazing green eyes and her sultry smile. There's something else. Something he can detect, but she'll never admit. Fascinated by her struggle with her amazing abilities, he becomes determined to help her accept who she is - and find the courage to open her heart. But before Ripley and Mac can dream of what lies in the future, they must confront the pain of the past. For the island shelters centuries of secrets - and a legacy of danger that plagues them still.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The bodies are curiously well preserved, even though they have been buried for centuries, and they are brought for study to a New York research facility under the authority of highly acclaimed Dr. Frederick Orville. But soon after the investigation begins, things go terribly wrong. The demonic souls of the beings are reanimated...and they are hell-bent on terror. Dr. Orville and his team work tirelessly in an underground bunker, under military guard, desperately trying to develop a serum to counteract the havoc the zombie-like terrorists wreak on their numerous victims. As a descendant of the Axosyz, only Doctor Orville's daughter has the spiritual insight necessary to direct the scientists and reveal the forces of good they'll need to overcome the evil that has been unleashed. The Evil in the Ice is a fast-paced science-fiction thriller that takes the reader to a place where disbelief is suspended, faith in God is questioned, and the mystery of immortality is tantalizingly close to being unraveled.\",\n",

Six members of his church have been found dead, killed by a rogue werewolf. He'll have to make a deal with the Devil to save victims that have gone missing -- maybe literally. Elise Kavanagh, preternatural investigator and exorcist, is the expert when it comes to violent deaths at the jaws of evil. She's also among the most powerful demons that Hell has spawned.\\nElise jumps at Lincoln's case, and it's not just because of his down-home charm. Someone's laid a trap for her in Northgate, and she wants to find out who. She'll have to team up with Rylie Gresham, Alpha of the last surviving werewolf pack, to figure out who's trying to blame the murders on werewolves. Only together can they stop the killings -- and uncover the secrets buried in Northgate.\",\n",

A dedicated, charismatic leader, sworn to uphold justice and set humanity free from the Sorcerer's rule, he will claim Divine Power to safeguard his people from an enemy he firmly believes will destroy them. Arithon, Master of Shadow. Brought up a trained mage, given a musical talent that has won him the title of Masterbard, he wishes for nothing but to defuse war and strife, and search out the vanished old races, whose grace holds the key to the world's fragmented peace. With the appalling destruction of the Vastmark warhost, recoil and grief reshapes the balance of power in the Five Kingdoms. Koriani enchantresses join forces with Lysaer in a desperate bid for power, and their intrigues threaten Arithon's hard-won autonomy. The aging Koriani Prime Matriarch wants the Shadow Master taken captive, no matter what the cost - or the means. For his life stands as her bargaining chip to break the deadlocked rivalry with the Fellowship Sorcerers.\",\n",

Her strategy? Join the Black Dagger Brotherhood's training center program and learn to fight for herself, think for herself...be herself. It's a good plan, until everything goes wrong. The schooling is unfathomably difficult, the other recruits feel more like enemies than allies, and it's very clear that the Brother in charge, Butch O'Neal, a.k.a. the Dhestroyer, is having serious problems in his own life.\\nAnd that's before she falls in love with a fellow classmate. Craeg, a common civilian, is nothing her father would ever want for her, but everything she could ask for in a male. As an act of violence threatens to tear apart the entire program, and the erotic pull between them grows irresistible, Paradise is tested in ways she never anticipated--and left wondering whether she's strong enough to claim her own power...on the field, and off.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This Author's Preferred Edition of Raymond E. Feist's bestselling coming-of-age saga celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of its publication. Feist introduces a new generation of readers to his riveting novel of adventure and intrigue, revised and updated as he always meant it to be written. It is a work that explores strength and weakness, hope and fear, and what it means to be a man--in a kingdom where peace is the most precious commodity of all.\\nIf there were two more impetuous and carefree men in the Kingdom of the Isles, they had yet to be found. Twins Borric and Erland wore that mantle proudly, much to the chagrin of their father, Prince Arutha of Krondor. But their blissful youth has come to an end. Their uncle, the King, has produced no male children. Bypassing himself, Arutha names Borric, the eldest twin by seconds, the Royal Heir. As his brother, Erland will have his own great responsibilities to shoulder. To drive home their future roles, Arutha sends them as ambassadors to Kesh, the most feared nation in the world. Borric and Erland will be presented to the Queen of Kesh--the single most powerful ruler in the known world--at her Seventy-fifth Jubilee Anniversary.\\nBut they have not even left Krondor when an assassination attempt on Borric is thwarted. Aware that he is being provoked into war, Arutha does not rise to the bait. His sons' journey will not be deterred, for nothing less than peace is riding on it. Yet there is to be no peace for the young princes. When their traveling party is ambushed, Borric disappears and is presumed dead--sending Erland into spirals of rage and grief as he is forced to navigate alone the court intrigues at Kesh. But unbeknownst to anyone, Borric lives and has escaped his captors. In a strange land, with a price on his head, Borric must use all his wits and stamina to find his way back to his brother.\\nOn separate paths, the two men--one a fugitive and one a future king--make their journey toward maturity, honor, and duty. For every step they take could sway the fragile peace of the land, as those who crave war rally against them--and become ever more daring.\\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\",\n",

A vaccination gone oh so wrong and a huge portion of the world's population was turned into Zombies. Reagan Willow is forced out of her home when her parents become casualties of the horrid Zombie Apocalypse. With the help of her best friend Haley, they've become experts on surviving the dangers of a world thrust into chaos and decay. Reagan and Haley are on a vague mission to find somewhere safe to live out the remainders of their terrifying life when they stumble upon the Parkers, a pack of brothers that seem to have the survival thing down in a much more efficient and successful way than Reagan could ever have imagined. They are also protecting their eight year old sister, Page, and will do anything to keep her safe. Zombies are a daily problem, constantly threatening the lives of their group, but they're not the only peril on the journey ahead. Militia groups of power hungry men are also a constant concern. And settlements of paranoid, suspicious people turn out to be just as hazardous. Love and Decay, Volume One, is a compilation of the first six episodes in a twelve episode season. It is a Dystopian Romance Novella Series about Zombies, the end of the world and finding someone to share it with. This story takes place over multiple episodes, with a release date every two weeks. Each episode is approximately 20,000 words.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"the gripping conclusion to the major new fantasy trilogy of necromancy and bone-chilling magic. Long ago Skala was ruled only by Queens, in accordance with prophecy. King Erius, fearing that the prophecy might be evoked as a means to dethrone him, had most of his female relatives assassinated. When his sister fell pregnant with twins, two of Skala's wizards were warned by the oracle and took steps to conceal the girl who survived her twin brother at birth. Now Prince tobin has been revealed as Princess tamir, the true heir to the throne - and Skala has never been more in need of a true Queen. But at the age of fifteen tamir is deeply confused by the new identity that has been thrust upon her, and feels betrayed by the wizards who tricked her and all her friends. Her demonic twin still haunts her, but now that the spell concealing her identity has been broken, the bond between them is severed. Brother is no longer under tamir's control, and he is bent on vengeance for the sins committed against him. Meanwhile Erius's son Korin, tamir's beloved cousin, has claimed the throne and declared her a traitor. But as the country slides into civil war the people begin to acclaim tamir as their saviour. tamir strives to avoid conflict, but Korin's weakness and tamir's honour will lead them to the ultimate clash of wills\",\n",

The problem is, his home is in a different dimension, and Dakota has no clue how to get back to Seattle, or Earth, or even her own time period.

Soon, he would begin to re-establish himself. As Vampire legends go, this was everything he had wanted for literally hundreds of years; since the end of the last time, anyway. But he had won, and after a time it had faded. Slowly and patiently he had put his 'life' back together again. He had focused on what he needed and what he wanted: a family. His intense focus was finally paying off; they had arrived. As the Vampire stories began.\\nOnce the first bite had taken place he had felt the rush of the vampyre existence, and it had woken him out of a dead sleep. Yes, someone was in his lair. Someone had found his truth and decided to explore it, much to their own personal detriment. What a gift! With four he could begin his family much, much faster than usual.\\nBut he is still missing one essential thing that will make his family complete. It is not the power he has gained, or the adoration or recognition. No, the one thing this Master of the Darkness is missing is a queen to rule by his side, a woman as cold and heartless as he himself. This added vampire romance to his dark life.\\nIn Rasia he tasted something in her he had never tasted in a woman before: evil, pure and simple. She had a heart as black as his. The only thing separating them was that he would live forever, and until he had her, she would not.\\nIn these vampire novels, to Cyril DeSai, that makes her perfect.\\nThe trilogy begins in these vampire books about trust and deceivement, with the potential of an apocalyptic reign.\",\n",

Sadie looks for peace every chance she gets, finding something like a sanctuary under a weeping willow and in the one thing her real father, SAM SUGARSPEAR, had left behind--a book about an imaginary land and the King that granted wishes, a book Sam read from each and every night to Sadie before he up and left.\\nBut one day, when Ralph's cruelty reaches unimaginable lows and he rapes Sadie, she runs away and hides inside a crevice in her beloved willow tree. To her surprise, the tree opens up completely, sending Sadie falling down into the abyss.\\nWhen she comes to, she learns that the strange land in which she has landed is a placed called the Land of Thornesboggle. And in this land, Sadie sets out on the mission of and for her life--to find the wish granting King that she'd so often read about and heard about from her father, the one and only KING ORPHANOS. She just knows that all her problems and all her pains will disappear if she could only speak to the King. Now if only things were that simple...\\nFrom every nook and cranny of this unfamiliar landscape, Sadie is confronted by the demons and monsters that she has carried inside her for so long, all of them coming to slimy and blood-thirsty life. There is nowhere to run. There is nowhere to hide. There is only one option--to use every drop of energy, wits, and faith she possesses to defeat the creatures that are coming for her to obtain the secret treasure that she unwittingly carries within her.\\nIt is a journey full of heartbreak, full of pain, full of physical challenges that seem insurmountable. It is a journey filled with giant snakes, kindly frogs, burning swamps, mud-men and witches, angels and vampires. It is a journey in which Sadie will not only test the limitations of her own strength, but will force her to learn to trust, to love, and to fight for what she believes in. It is a journey in which she falls in love, experiences sex and passion, and finds that the King of Wishes is not what she'd hoped he'd be.\\nUltimately, Sadie grows into a woman through the experience and when she encounters the one person who she has longed for more than anybody else, even more than the King himself--her father, Sam--she realizes that she has all the tools now to live her life without him, that inside, she has found the strength to make her own wishes\\ncome true.\\nfind at amazon:\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sugarspear-Weep...\",\n",

The details of her personal life during that time are hardly less private, having provided fodder for gossips in several countries.\\nAs is so often the case in the career of this illustrious woman, the public story is far from complete. In this, the fourth volume of her memoirs, Lady Trent relates how she acquired her position with the Royal Scirling Army; how foreign saboteurs imperiled both her work and her well-being; and how her determined pursuit of knowledge took her into the deepest reaches of the Labyrinth of Drakes, where the chance action of a dragon set the stage for her greatest achievement yet.\",\n",

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.\\nAnd strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.\\nBut each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself.\",\n",
